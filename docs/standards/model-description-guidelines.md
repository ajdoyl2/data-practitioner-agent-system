# Model Description Guidelines for SQLmesh Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for writing clear, consistent, and useful model descriptions in SQLmesh transformations. Well-written descriptions improve discoverability, understanding, and maintenance across data engineering teams.

## Description Writing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Audience-First**: Write for the person discovering your model for the first time
2. **Business-Focused**: Lead with business value, follow with technical details  
3. **Action-Oriented**: Use active voice and concrete language
4. **Context-Rich**: Provide enough context for informed decision-making
5. **Maintenance-Friendly**: Keep descriptions current with model evolution

### Description Hierarchy
```yaml
description_levels:
  catalog_description:
    purpose: "High-level model discovery in data catalogs"
    length: "1-2 sentences (150 characters max)"
    audience: "Business users, data consumers"
    focus: "What the model provides and why it matters"
    
  model_header_description:
    purpose: "Comprehensive model understanding"
    length: "2-4 sentences (300-500 characters)"
    audience: "Data engineers, analysts, stakeholders"
    focus: "Business context, data sources, key transformations"
    
  inline_documentation:
    purpose: "Implementation details and complex logic"
    length: "Variable based on complexity"
    audience: "Implementers, maintainers"
    focus: "How transformations work and why specific approaches were chosen"
```

## Catalog Description Standards

### Format Template
```
[Business Domain] [Data Subject] providing [Key Value Proposition] for [Primary Use Cases]. [Update Frequency] refresh from [Primary Sources].
```

### Catalog Description Examples

#### Excellent Examples
```sql
-- EXCELLENT: Clear business value, context, and usage
MODEL (
    name analytics.customer_360_daily,
    description 'Comprehensive daily customer profiles combining transaction history, demographics, and behavioral metrics for segmentation, churn prediction, and personalized marketing campaigns. Daily refresh from CRM, POS, and web analytics.'
);

-- EXCELLENT: Specific domain and clear utility
MODEL (
    name finance.revenue_recognition_monthly,
    description 'Monthly revenue recognition calculations following ASC 606 standards for financial reporting and audit compliance. Automated processing from billing and contract management systems.'
);

-- EXCELLENT: Clear aggregation and business purpose
MODEL (
    name operations.supply_chain_kpis_weekly,
    description 'Weekly supply chain performance metrics including inventory turnover, delivery times, and supplier scorecards for operational decision-making. Sourced from ERP and logistics systems.'
);
```

#### Poor Examples (and how to improve them)
```sql
-- POOR: Too technical, no business context
MODEL (
    name analytics.customer_360_daily,
    description 'Joins customer tables with transaction data using complex window functions and applies segmentation logic.'
);
-- IMPROVED: Lead with business value
description 'Daily customer analytics combining demographics and transaction history for marketing segmentation and retention analysis. Complex aggregations from CRM and transaction systems.'

-- POOR: Vague and uninformative
MODEL (
    name finance.monthly_report,
    description 'Monthly financial data for reporting purposes.'
);
-- IMPROVED: Specific purpose and compliance context
description 'Monthly financial statements including P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow for executive reporting and regulatory compliance. GAAP-compliant calculations from general ledger.'

-- POOR: Implementation details without business context
MODEL (
    name operations.inventory_snapshot,
    description 'Incremental model that processes inventory changes using SCD Type 2 patterns with daily partition refresh.'
);
-- IMPROVED: Business value with technical context
description 'Daily inventory levels and movements for demand planning and reorder optimization. Historical tracking supports trend analysis and forecast accuracy measurement.'
```

## Best Practices and Anti-Patterns

### Description Best Practices

#### Do's â
- **Lead with business value**: Start with what the model provides, not how it works
- **Use active voice**: "Provides customer insights" vs "Customer insights are provided"
- **Include concrete metrics**: "85% accuracy" vs "high accuracy"
- **Specify refresh frequency**: "Daily updates" vs "regular updates"
- **Mention primary sources**: "from CRM and POS systems" vs "from various systems"
- **Define abbreviations**: "Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)" vs "CLV"
- **Use parallel structure**: Consistent format across similar models
- **Update with changes**: Keep descriptions current with model evolution

#### Don'ts â
- **Avoid implementation details**: Don't describe joins, window functions, or SQL specifics
- **Skip obvious statements**: Don't say "This model contains data" or "Uses SQL"
- **Use undefined acronyms**: Avoid TLA (Three Letter Acronyms) without definition
- **Be vague about purpose**: "For analysis" vs "For customer segmentation analysis"
- **Ignore your audience**: Consider who will read this in 6 months
- **Copy-paste descriptions**: Each model should have unique, specific description
- **Use outdated information**: Remove references to deprecated systems or processes

### Common Anti-Patterns

#### Anti-Pattern: Technical Implementation Focus
```sql
-- BAD: Technical details without business context
description 'Uses LEFT JOIN between customer and transaction tables with ROW_NUMBER() window function to deduplicate records and calculate monthly aggregations using SUM() and COUNT() functions.'

-- GOOD: Business purpose with minimal technical context
description 'Monthly customer spending summaries for sales performance analysis and territory planning. Aggregates transaction history to identify spending trends and high-value customer segments.'
```

#### Anti-Pattern: Vague Business Speak
```sql
-- BAD: Generic business language without specifics
description 'Customer data model for business intelligence and analytics purposes providing insights for strategic decision making and operational excellence.'

-- GOOD: Specific business outcomes and use cases
description 'Customer demographic and transaction profiles for marketing segmentation and retention campaigns. Enables personalized email targeting and churn risk identification with daily refresh from CRM systems.'
```

#### Anti-Pattern: Missing Context
```sql
-- BAD: No indication of scope, sources, or frequency
description 'Revenue calculations for financial reporting.'

-- GOOD: Complete context for informed usage
description 'Monthly revenue recognition following ASC 606 standards for SEC reporting and audit compliance. Processes subscription and professional services revenue from billing and contract management systems.'
```
