- Story 1.2 → Story 1.3 → Story 1.4 → Story 1.5

### Track B: Analysis Tools (After Story 1.3)
- Story 1.6 (EDA) - Can start after Story 1.3

### Track C: Publishing (After Story 1.3)
- Story 1.7 (Evidence) - Can start after Story 1.3

### Track D: Quality Assurance (Immediate)
- Story 1.8 (QA) - Can start immediately after Story 1.1.5

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Critical Risks
1. **Security Implementation Delays**
   - Impact: Blocks all other development
   - Mitigation: Dedicated senior developer, daily progress checks

2. **Python/Node.js Integration Issues**
   - Impact: Affects Stories 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
   - Mitigation: Early prototype testing, fallback strategies

3. **External Service Dependencies**
   - Impact: Blocks integration testing
   - Mitigation: Mock services for development, sandbox accounts ready

### Rollback Readiness
- Each story must have rollback script tested before marking complete
- Feature flags must be tested in both enabled/disabled states
- Security logging must capture all rollback operations

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Developer Assignments
- **Senior Developer**: Story 1.1.5 (Security) - Full dedication
- **Backend Developer 1**: Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (Core Pipeline)
- **Backend Developer 2**: Stories 1.5, 1.6 (Orchestration & Analysis)
- **Full-Stack Developer**: Story 1.7 (Evidence.dev)
- **QA Engineer**: Story 1.8 + Testing support across all stories

### Testing Resources
- Automated testing for each story (80% coverage minimum)
- Security testing specialist for Story 1.1.5 (95% coverage required)
- Integration testing after each phase completion

## Progress Tracking Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
1. **Development Complete**: All tasks checked off
2. **Unit Tests Pass**: ≥80% coverage (95% for security)
3. **Integration Tests Pass**: Cross-story functionality verified
4. **Security Tests Pass**: Authentication, authorization, logging verified
5. **Documentation Complete**: Technical and user documentation updated
6. **Rollback Tested**: Rollback script successfully validated

### Daily Standup Focus Areas
- Security implementation progress (Phase 1)
- Integration issues and blockers
- Test coverage metrics
- Feature flag status
- External dependency readiness

- No disruption to existing BMad-Method functionality
- Safe integration of external tools
- Clear value delivery at each phase

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Begin Story 1.1.5 development with senior developer
2. **Resource Preparation**: 
   - Set up development environments
   - Obtain external service credentials
   - Create sandbox accounts for testing
3. **Communication Setup**:
   - Daily standups scheduled
   - Slack channel for real-time coordination
   - Weekly stakeholder updates planned

This development sequence ensures safe, progressive implementation of the Data Practitioner Agent System while maintaining the integrity of the existing BMad-Method framework.
