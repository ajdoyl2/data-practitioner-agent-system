## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Stories 1.1-1.3 implemented the foundational data pipeline components: agent infrastructure, PyAirbyte ingestion, and DuckDB analytics. This story adds sophisticated orchestration and monitoring capabilities that will coordinate these components and the upcoming dbt transformations (Story 1.5) as unified workflows.

### WorkflowOrchestrator Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#workfloworchestrator]

**Responsibility:** Manages Dagster asset-centric workflow orchestration, pipeline scheduling, and comprehensive monitoring across all data operations

**Key Interfaces Required:**
- Dagster asset definition and dependency management
- Pipeline scheduling and trigger mechanism configuration
- Monitoring dashboard integration with existing BMad progress tracking
- Error handling and retry logic following BMad failure recovery patterns

**Technology Stack Dependencies:**
- Dagster ^1.8.12 (workflow orchestration framework)
- Python subprocess execution for Dagster daemon and web UI
- Web UI integration for monitoring and management
- Existing Components: CLI orchestration, progress tracking (ora), workflow management systems
- New Components: DataIngestionService (Story 1.2), AnalyticalEngine (Story 1.3), TransformationEngine (Story 1.5), PublicationEngine (Story 1.7)

### Dagster Technical Specifications
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#new-technology-additions]

**Dagster Version:** ^1.8.12  
**Purpose:** Workflow orchestration  
**Rationale:** Latest stable with enhanced asset lineage and improved web UI performance  
**Integration Method:** Python subprocess with web UI integration

**Key Capabilities to Implement:**
- Asset-centric design treating data assets (tables, files, ML models) as first-class citizens
- Software-defined assets with intuitive dependency tracking and built-in lineage visualization
- Asset checks and data quality monitoring with real-time alerts
- Partitioning strategies (time-based, custom, dynamic) with resource management and cost optimization

### Asset-Centric Design Implementation
**Asset Definition Strategy:**
- Data Sources: PyAirbyte connectors as upstream assets with refresh scheduling
- Analytical Tables: DuckDB tables as materialized assets with dependency tracking
- Transformation Models: dbt models as assets with lineage to source tables
- Publication Artifacts: Evidence.dev sites as downstream assets consuming transformed data

**Asset Dependency Mapping:**
```python
# Example asset dependency structure
@asset(deps=[pyairbyte_data_source])
def duckdb_analytical_table():
    # Load data from PyAirbyte into DuckDB
    pass

@asset(deps=[duckdb_analytical_table])
def dbt_transformation_model():
    # Execute dbt transformations
    pass

@asset(deps=[dbt_transformation_model])
def evidence_publication():
    # Generate Evidence.dev publication
    pass
```

### Dagster Configuration Management
**Dagster Workspace Configuration:**
```yaml
# dagster.yaml
scheduler:
  module: dagster.core.scheduler
  class: DagsterDaemonScheduler

run_coordinator:
  module: dagster.core.run_coordinator
  class: DefaultRunCoordinator

compute_logs:
  module: dagster.core.storage.compute_log_manager
  class: LocalComputeLogManager
  config:
    base_dir: "logs"

# workspace.yaml

```

### Monitoring and Alerting Framework
**Integration with BMad Progress Tracking:**
- Use existing BMad progress patterns (ora, chalk) for pipeline status display
- Extend existing error handling patterns with Dagster-specific error contexts
- Integrate with existing CLI orchestration for manual pipeline triggers
- Add pipeline status to existing BMad workflow management systems

**Alerting Configuration:**
```yaml
monitoring:
  dagster:
    webUI:
      enabled: true
      port: 3001
      host: "localhost"
    alerting:
      channels:
        - type: "webhook"
          url: "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/alerts"
        - type: "console"
          level: "error"
    metrics:
      collection_interval: "30s"
      retention_period: "7d"
```

### Scheduling and Triggering Strategies
**Time-Based Scheduling:**
- Daily data refresh schedules for regular reporting
- Hourly incremental updates for real-time analytics
- Weekly comprehensive pipeline execution for data quality validation

**Event-Driven Triggers:**
- File system sensors for new data source detection
- Database change sensors for upstream data modifications
- API webhook sensors for external system notifications

**Manual Trigger Integration:**
- BMad agent command integration for on-demand pipeline execution
- CLI trigger mechanisms following existing BMad patterns
- Web UI integration for manual pipeline management

### Performance and Resource Management
**Resource Usage Optimization:**
- Configurable resource limits for Dagster daemon and web UI processes
- Asset partitioning strategies for efficient processing of large datasets
- Memory usage monitoring with automatic cleanup of completed runs
- Concurrent execution limits to prevent system overload

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Asset execution time tracking with performance regression detection
- Resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- Pipeline bottleneck identification and optimization recommendations
- Cost optimization through efficient scheduling and resource allocation

### Integration with Previous Stories
**PyAirbyte Integration (Story 1.2):**
- Wrap PyAirbyte data ingestion processes as Dagster assets
- Add scheduling for periodic data source refresh
- Implement data source monitoring and failure alerting

**DuckDB Integration (Story 1.3):**
- Define DuckDB analytical operations as Dagster assets
- Add dependency tracking between ingestion and analytics assets
- Implement analytical query scheduling and monitoring

**dbt Integration (Story 1.5):**
- Integrate dbt transformation workflows as Dagster assets
- Add lineage tracking between source data and transformation outputs
- Implement transformation quality monitoring and validation

### Error Handling and Recovery Patterns
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#enhancement-specific-standards]

**Dagster Error Handling:**
- Python subprocess errors wrapped and translated to Node.js error objects
- Comprehensive retry policies for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when Dagster daemon unavailable
- Asset failure isolation to prevent cascade failures
- Recovery workflows for partial pipeline failures

### Integration Points with Existing System
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#critical-integration-rules]

**Existing API Compatibility:** All existing BMad-Method workflow patterns must remain completely unchanged - Dagster orchestration operates as an additional layer over existing functionality

**BMad Integration Requirements:**
- Extend existing BMad workflow patterns with Dagster coordination
- Integrate with CLI orchestration for pipeline management commands
- Use existing progress tracking patterns for pipeline status display
- Maintain existing error handling and recovery mechanisms
