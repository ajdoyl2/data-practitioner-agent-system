### LLM-Agnostic Hypothesis Generation Architecture
**Multi-Provider LLM Integration Pattern:**
```javascript
// Provider abstraction following existing agent LLM patterns
class HypothesisGenerator {
  constructor(provider = 'anthropic') {
    this.provider = this.initializeProvider(provider);
  }
  
  async generateHypotheses(edaReport, domain = null) {
    const prompt = this.buildHypothesisPrompt(edaReport, domain);
    return await this.provider.generate(prompt);
  }
  
  // Compatible with existing agent LLM usage patterns
  initializeProvider(type) {
    switch(type) {
      case 'openai': return new OpenAIProvider();
      case 'anthropic': return new AnthropicProvider();
      case 'google': return new GoogleProvider();
      case 'local': return new LocalModelProvider();
      default: throw new Error(`Unsupported LLM provider: ${type}`);
    }
  }
}
```
