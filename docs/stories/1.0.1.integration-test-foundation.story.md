## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Framework:** Jest ^30.0.4 extended with Python subprocess testing utilities and DuckDB in-memory testing capabilities  
**Location:** `/tests/data-services/` following existing test organization patterns, mirroring source code structure  
**Coverage Target:** 80% minimum coverage for all data processing components, 90% coverage for critical data integrity operations  
**Integration with Existing:** Leverages existing Jest configuration and test utilities, extends existing validation patterns for data-specific components

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- End-to-end data workflows from ingestion through publication
- Cross-component data flow validation  
- Python-Node.js interoperability testing
- All existing BMad-Method functionality must continue working unchanged
- Regression testing for core agent workflows and CLI tools

**Test Organization:** Tests organized under `/tests/` directory following component-based structure, integration tests preferred over extensive unit testing

### Critical Integration Rules
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]

**Existing API Compatibility:** All existing BMad-Method CLI commands, agent workflows, and web-builder functionality must remain completely unchanged - new functionality is purely additive through expansion pack patterns

**Error Handling Integration:** Consistent logging patterns across all data components, error handling strategy comprehensive with retry policies and fallback approaches, system can recover from partial failures

**Python Code Integration Standards:** All Python code executed through Node.js subprocess interfaces, Python scripts follow PEP 8 standards with black formatting, virtual environment isolation with pinned dependency versions

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: Existing codebase structure]

- Test files should follow existing `/tests/` directory structure
- Integration tests in `/tests/integration/`
- Data service tests in `/tests/data-services/`
- Performance tests in `/tests/performance/`
- Test utilities in `/tests/utils/`
- Test fixtures in `/tests/fixtures/`

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first preparatory story - no previous story context available. This foundation is critical for all subsequent data practitioner stories.

## Testing

Based on testing strategy documentation:
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all test utilities
- Implement integration tests that validate the test framework itself
- Ensure test suite can detect regression in existing BMad functionality
- Test utilities must work with both existing and new data processing components
