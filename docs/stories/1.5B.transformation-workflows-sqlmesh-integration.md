## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** data engineer,
**I want** to explicitly choose and execute transformation workflows using SQLmesh with cost optimization and blue-green deployment,
**so that** I can reduce warehouse costs by 30-50% through virtual environments and deploy models safely with zero-downtime.

## Dev Notes

### SQLmesh Technology Overview
SQLmesh is a data transformation framework that addresses legacy tool limitations through:
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent execution reduces warehouse costs through virtual environments
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Safe model deployment with automatic rollback capabilities
- **Embedded Documentation**: Documentation and configuration within SQL files, reducing YAML overhead
- **Python + SQL Support**: Native support for both SQL and Python models in single framework
- **Automatic Dependencies**: Dependency detection without manual specification

### Integration Architecture
**Dual-Engine Strategy with Explicit Selection**: Both dbt and SQLmesh coexist with user choice:
- **No auto-detection** - User must explicitly select engine via:
  - CLI flag: `--engine=sqlmesh` or `--engine=dbt`
  - API header: `X-Transform-Engine: sqlmesh`
  - Interactive prompt if not specified
- Feature flags control availability of each engine
- Configuration file specifies enabled engines and defaults
- Transformation engine factory enforces explicit selection

**Environment Strategy (4 environments)**:
- **dev**: Virtual-only execution, no compute costs, 7-day retention
- **staging**: Daily refresh, sampled data option, 30-day retention
- **prod**: Full data, blue-green deployment, 90-day retention, backups
- **feature_***: Dynamic branch environments, 14-day retention, auto-cleanup

**SQLmesh Project Structure**:

```

**Cost Optimization Features**:
- Virtual data environments prevent unnecessary warehouse usage
- Intelligent execution strategies minimize compute costs
- Blue-green deployment eliminates production errors and rollback costs
- Embedded documentation reduces maintenance overhead

### Blue-Green Deployment Capabilities
**SQLmesh Native Support**: SQLmesh provides built-in blue-green deployment via the `migrate` command:
- Creates shadow environment with new changes
- Runs all validations and audits in shadow
- Performs atomic swap on success
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Zero downtime during deployment

### Security Integration
Following Story 1.1.5 security framework:
- API key authentication for all SQLmesh transformation endpoints
- Feature flag 'sqlmesh_transformations' controls service availability
- Security logging for all SQLmesh operations with sensitive data filtering
- Integration with existing security patterns and validation

### Migration Guide from dbt to SQLmesh
**Step-by-Step Migration Process**:
1. **Model Conversion**:
   - dbt YAML configs → SQLmesh embedded MODEL statements
   - Jinja templates → SQLmesh macros or Python models
   - dbt tests → SQLmesh audits
2. **Dependencies**:
   - SQLmesh auto-detects dependencies (no manual ref() needed)
   - Incremental models use SQLmesh's `@incremental_by_time` decorator
3. **Configuration**:
   - profiles.yml → config.yaml gateway settings
   - dbt_project.yml → SQLmesh model_defaults
4. **Commands**:
   - `dbt run` → `sqlmesh run`
   - `dbt test` → `sqlmesh audit`
   - `dbt docs` → SQLmesh auto-generates from MODEL statements

### Cost Calculation Formula
**Virtual Environment Savings Calculation**:
```python
# Cost savings formula
savings_percentage = (
    (physical_compute_hours - virtual_compute_hours) / 
    physical_compute_hours
) * 100

# Where:
# - physical_compute_hours = actual warehouse compute time
# - virtual_compute_hours = 0 for dev, reduced for staging
# - Example: (100 hours - 50 hours) / 100 hours = 50% savings
```

**Tracking Metrics**:
- Compute hours saved per environment
- Cost per compute hour (varies by warehouse)
- Monthly/quarterly savings reports
- ROI = (savings - implementation_cost) / implementation_cost

### Troubleshooting Guide
**Common Issues and Solutions**:
1. **SQLmesh not found**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and sqlmesh installed
2. **Engine not specified error**: Add `--engine=sqlmesh` flag or `X-Transform-Engine` header
3. **Virtual environment cost tracking**: Check `.sqlmesh/runtime.json` for metrics
4. **Blue-green deployment fails**: Review audit logs in `.sqlmesh/audits/`
5. **Python bridge communication**: Verify JSON formatting in sqlmesh_bridge.py logs

## Testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT with Critical Configuration Issues** ⚠️

The implementation quality is exceptionally high with comprehensive architecture, proper error handling, and professional code patterns. However, critical configuration issues prevent the feature from functioning correctly in production.

**Implementation Strengths:**
- **Professional Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with SQLmeshWrapper, TransformationEngineFactory, and CostTracker
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive timeout handling, subprocess management, and graceful degradation
- **Security Integration**: Proper authentication middleware and security logging patterns
- **Cost Optimization**: Advanced cost tracking with virtual environment savings calculation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Well-structured test suite with proper mocking and coverage

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `bmad-method/config/feature-flags.yaml`
- **Change**: Added missing `sqlmesh_transformations` feature flag
- **Why**: SQLmesh wrapper checks for this flag but it was not defined in configuration
- **How**: Added proper feature flag with dependencies and safety settings

**File**: `tools/data-services/transformation-engine-factory.js` 
- **Change**: Fixed feature flag path resolution to use bmad-method/config/features.json
- **Why**: Code was looking for config/features.json but flags are in bmad-method/config/feature-flags.yaml
- **How**: Updated path resolution and added YAML parsing support

**File**: `tools/data-services/sqlmesh-wrapper.js`
- **Change**: Fixed feature flag configuration path and format
- **Why**: Feature flag checking was using incorrect path and JSON format instead of YAML
- **How**: Updated to use correct bmad-method/config/feature-flags.yaml path with YAML parsing

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ Professional Node.js patterns with proper error handling
- **Project Structure**: ✅ Files properly organized following BMad patterns
