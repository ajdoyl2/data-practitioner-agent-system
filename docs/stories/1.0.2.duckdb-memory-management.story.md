## Dev Notes

### DuckDB Integration Context
[Source: docs/prd.md, docs/architecture.md]

**DuckDB Purpose:** Embedded analytical database for in-process data processing, supporting larger-than-memory datasets through smart partitioning
**Integration Approach:** DuckDB operates as embedded analytics engine without impacting existing file-based storage
**Performance Requirements:** Sub-3-second response times for interactive analysis operations
**Scaling Strategy:** Local processing with cloud scaling documentation, handle datasets from megabytes to terabytes

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md]

**Data Processing Standards:** DuckDB operations wrapped with proper error handling and resource management
**Error Handling Integration:** All data processing errors use existing BMad error patterns with chalk styling, graceful degradation when data tools unavailable with clear user messaging
**Resource Management:** System can recover from partial failures, comprehensive retry policies and fallback approaches

### BMad-Method Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture.md]

**Compatibility Requirements:** DuckDB operates in isolation for data processing only, with no impact on YAML/Markdown file structures
**Performance Impact:** Data processing operations isolated in separate processes/subprocesses to prevent blocking existing Node.js event loop
**Memory Usage:** Managed through configurable DuckDB limits and automatic spilling strategies

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: Existing codebase structure]

- Documentation should be created in `/docs/architecture/` or `/docs/data-processing/`
- Configuration templates in `/bmad-data-practitioner/data/`
- Monitoring scripts in `/tools/data-services/`
- Performance documentation in `/docs/performance/`

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md]

**Response Times:** <3 seconds for interactive analysis operations, <100ms for UI interactions
**Scalability:** Support datasets ranging from megabytes to terabytes through appropriate scaling strategies
**Resource Management:** Handle larger-than-memory datasets through smart partitioning and memory management

## Testing

Based on testing strategy documentation:
- Create performance tests that validate memory management under various load conditions
- Test memory limit enforcement and spilling mechanisms
- Validate integration with existing BMad resource monitoring
- Test fallback procedures under resource exhaustion scenarios
- Create automated tests for partitioning strategies with large datasets

## QA Results

**Review Date:** 2025-08-14  
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)  
**Review Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION - Multiple Critical Issues Found

### 📊 Overall Assessment

**Story Completion Status:** 85% Complete with Critical Gaps  
**Code Quality Rating:** B+ (Good structure, needs implementation)  
**Test Coverage:** 60% (Basic testing present, integration gaps)  
**Documentation Quality:** A- (Comprehensive but some inaccuracies)  
**Security Compliance:** A (Well integrated with BMad security patterns)

### 🚨 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

#### 1. **Feature Flag Dependencies Not Properly Configured**
- **Issue:** Tests failing because feature flags `pyairbyte_integration` and `duckdb_analytics` are enabled by default in test environment
- **Impact:** Integration tests cannot properly validate feature lifecycle management
- **Location:** `tests/integration/security-integration.test.js:150`
- **Fix Required:** Update feature flag configuration to have proper test defaults

#### 2. **Missing Core DuckDB Implementation**
- **Issue:** DuckDB integration returns "not available or disabled" error during initialization
- **Impact:** Core functionality cannot be tested or validated  
- **Location:** `tools/data-services/duckdb-wrapper.js:71`
- **Fix Required:** Complete DuckDB wrapper implementation or provide proper fallback handling

#### 3. **Incomplete Service Credential Integration**
- **Issue:** Credential masking functionality not implemented (`password` returns `undefined` instead of `***`)
- **Location:** `tests/integration/security-integration.test.js:246`
- **Fix Required:** Implement credential masking in service credentials manager

#### 4. **Rollback Manager API Mismatch**
- **Issue:** Security logging expects different rollback event signature than what's being called
- **Location:** `tests/integration/security-integration.test.js:214`
- **Fix Required:** Align rollback manager API with security logger expectations

### ⚠️ High Priority Issues

#### 5. **Test Infrastructure Incomplete**
- **Issue:** Multiple rollback manager tests failing due to missing filesystem setup
- **Impact:** Cannot validate rollback functionality which is critical for memory management
- **Fix Required:** Complete test setup and filesystem mocking

#### 6. **Authentication Workflow Gap**
- **Issue:** `logAuthSuccess` never called in end-to-end security workflow
- **Impact:** Audit trail incomplete for security operations
- **Fix Required:** Ensure all security operations properly log authentication events

### 📋 Medium Priority Issues

#### 7. **Memory Monitoring Integration**
- **Observation:** Memory monitoring starts correctly but needs validation of integration with DuckDB memory limits
- **Recommendation:** Add integration tests specifically for memory threshold validation

#### 8. **Performance Baseline Updates**
- **Observation:** Performance baselines show reasonable response times but need DuckDB-specific benchmarks
- **Recommendation:** Add DuckDB performance benchmarks once core implementation is complete

### ✅ Strengths Identified

1. **Excellent Architecture Design**
   - Well-structured monitoring components with proper separation of concerns
   - Resource monitor, dashboard, and CLI integration follow good design patterns
   - Proper event-driven architecture with EventEmitter pattern

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**
