# Story 1.1.5: Security & Risk Management Foundation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** data platform administrator,
**I want** a foundational security and risk management framework for the data practitioner expansion pack,
**so that** external integrations and data operations can be deployed safely with proper authentication, monitoring, and rollback capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement MVP API Key Authentication System for data service endpoints
2. Create Configuration-based Feature Flag System for progressive story rollout
3. Establish Per-Story Rollback Procedures with validation and recovery scripts

5. Create Security Monitoring and Logging Foundation with audit capabilities

## Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing BMad-Method functionality remains completely unaffected

## Dev Notes

### Security Architecture Philosophy
[Source: PO Master Checklist validation findings]

**Security Bridge Pattern**: This story acts as a security bridge between the completed foundation (Story 1.1) and external integrations (Stories 1.2-1.8), implementing minimal viable security that can be enhanced post-MVP.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Defense in depth with layered security controls
- Fail-safe defaults (deny by default, explicit allow)
- Progressive security enhancement (MVP now, advanced later)
- Audit everything (comprehensive security logging)
- Recovery-oriented security (robust rollback capabilities)

### Technical Implementation Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#security-standards]

**Authentication Approach:**
```javascript
// MVP API Key System - Simple but Secure
const authConfig = {
  strategy: 'api_key_basic',
  storage: 'environment_variables', 
  validation: 'header_based',
  scopes: ['data_read', 'data_write', 'admin']
};
```

**Feature Flag System:**
```yaml
# config/feature-flags.yaml - Progressive Rollout Control
features:
  pyairbyte_integration: false    # Story 1.2 toggle
  duckdb_analytics: false         # Story 1.3 toggle
  dbt_transformations: false      # Story 1.4 toggle
  dagster_orchestration: false    # Story 1.5 toggle
  eda_automation: false           # Story 1.6 toggle
  evidence_publishing: false      # Story 1.7 toggle
```

### Integration Points with Existing System
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#security-integration]

**BMad-Method Core Integration:**
- Extends existing CLI patterns with security commands
- Integrates with current YAML configuration management
- Preserves existing agent orchestration while adding security layers
- Maintains expansion pack architecture compliance

**Data Services Security Integration:**
- All data service endpoints require authentication
- Feature flags control data service availability
- Security events logged through existing BMad logging patterns
- Rollback procedures preserve existing system state

### Rollback Architecture Design
[Source: PO validation - Critical requirement for brownfield safety]

**Per-Story Rollback Strategy:**
```bash
# Rollback Script Template Structure
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-story-X.X.sh

# 1. Stop related services
# 2. Remove installed dependencies  
# 3. Clean up data/configuration
# 4. Restore previous state
# 5. Validate rollback success
# 6. Update feature flags
```

**Rollback Validation Framework:**
- Pre-rollback state capture
- Post-rollback integrity verification
- Automated rollback testing in CI/CD
- Manual rollback procedures for emergency scenarios

### External Service Security Model
[Source: PO validation - Authentication and credential management gaps]

**Service Integration Security:**
- API keys stored in environment variables only
- Service-specific credential scoping
- Credential rotation documentation and procedures
- Health checks for external service connectivity
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable

### Security Monitoring Integration
[Source: architecture/infrastructure-and-deployment-integration.md#monitoring]

**Audit Logging Framework:**
```javascript
// Security Event Types
const SecurityEvents = {
  AUTH_SUCCESS: 'auth_success',
  AUTH_FAILURE: 'auth_failure', 
  PERMISSION_DENIED: 'permission_denied',
  FEATURE_FLAG_CHANGED: 'feature_flag_changed',
  ROLLBACK_INITIATED: 'rollback_initiated',
  EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR: 'external_service_error'
};
```

**Integration with Existing Monitoring:**
- Extends existing BMad logging with security events
- Maintains log format compatibility 
- Adds structured security event metadata
- Preserves existing log rotation and retention

## Testing

### Security Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#security-testing]

**Authentication Testing:**
- Valid API key acceptance tests
- Invalid API key rejection tests  
- Scope-based permission validation tests
- Header manipulation and injection tests

**Feature Flag Testing:**
- Feature enable/disable functionality tests
- Service behavior with flags enabled/disabled
- Flag persistence and reload tests
- Invalid flag configuration handling tests

**Rollback Testing:**
- Individual story rollback validation
- Sequential rollback testing
- Rollback failure and recovery tests
- State integrity verification tests

**Security Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end security workflow tests
- Integration with existing BMad security patterns
- External service authentication tests  
- Security logging and monitoring tests

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- 95% test coverage for all security components
- Integration tests for all rollback procedures
- Load testing for authentication performance
- Security penetration testing for API endpoints
