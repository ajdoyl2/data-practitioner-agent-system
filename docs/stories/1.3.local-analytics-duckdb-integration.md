## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.1 established the expansion pack structure. Story 1.1.5 implemented the security foundation including API authentication and feature flags. Story 1.2 implemented PyAirbyte data ingestion with caching capabilities. This story builds on that foundation by implementing the AnalyticalEngine component that processes the cached data through DuckDB for analytical queries with proper security integration.

### AnalyticalEngine Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#analyticalengine]

**Responsibility:** Manages DuckDB embedded database operations, automated EDA execution, and LLM-agnostic hypothesis generation workflows

**Key Interfaces Required:**
- DuckDB query execution interface with memory management and partitioning
- Automated EDA tool integration (pandas-profiling, Sweetviz, AutoViz) - interfaces only, implementation in Story 1.6
- LLM hypothesis generation interface supporting multiple providers - interfaces only, implementation in Story 1.6
- Statistical testing framework integration with configurable test selection - interfaces only, implementation in Story 1.6

**Technology Stack Dependencies:**
- DuckDB ^1.1.3 (embedded analytical database)
- Python subprocess execution (for EDA tools in future stories)
- Configurable LLM interfaces (for hypothesis generation in future stories)
- Existing Components: Agent orchestration system, template engine, natural language workflow processing
- New Components: DataIngestionService (data sources), TransformationEngine (processed data - Story 1.4)

### DuckDB Technical Specifications
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#new-technology-additions]

**DuckDB Version:** ^1.1.3  
**Purpose:** Embedded analytical database  
**Rationale:** Latest stable with performance improvements and WASM support for Evidence.dev  
**Integration Method:** Node.js bindings with subprocess fallback

**Key Capabilities to Implement:**
- Columnar architecture and vectorized execution for analytical queries
- Larger-than-memory datasets through smart partitioning and out-of-core processing
- Multi-format support (CSV, Parquet, JSON) from local filesystem, HTTP endpoints, cloud storage
- Partial file reading and intelligent caching for performance optimization

### Data Model Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#datasource]

**DataSource Model Integration:**
- cache_location: String - DuckDB table reference for processed data
- schema_metadata: Object - Discovered schema information for EDA workflows
- ingestion_status tracking for DuckDB loading state

**DuckDB Schema Strategy:**
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#schema-integration-strategy]
- New Tables: DuckDB tables for data processing (managed dynamically, not persistent schema)
- New Indexes: DuckDB indexes created dynamically based on query patterns
- DuckDB operates in isolation - no impact on existing file-based storage

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]

└── analytics_cache/               # NEW: Query result caching directory
```

### Memory Management Requirements
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#analyticalengine]

**Memory Management and Partitioning:**
- Smart partitioning and out-of-core processing for larger-than-memory datasets

    memoryLimit: "4GB"
    maxConnections: 10
    partitionSize: "256MB"
  queryCache:
    enabled: true
    maxSize: "1GB"
    ttl: "1h"
  security:
    authentication: required
    apiKeyScope: "data_read"
    featureFlag: "duckdb_analytics"
    auditLogging: true
```

### Integration with PyAirbyte Cache
**Data Loading Interface:**
- Interface between DataIngestionService (Story 1.2) and AnalyticalEngine
- Load PyAirbyte cached data into DuckDB tables
- Schema detection and validation from PyAirbyte metadata
- Automated table creation with proper column types and constraints
- Incremental loading for updated data sources

### Multi-Format Support Implementation
**Supported Formats:**
- CSV: Customizable delimiters, headers, encoding options
- Parquet: Columnar format for efficient analytical queries
- JSON: Nested structure support with automatic flattening options
- Automatic format detection from file extensions and content analysis
- Format-specific optimization settings for query performance

### Performance and Scalability Requirements
**Larger-than-Memory Dataset Support:**
- DuckDB's out-of-core processing capabilities for datasets exceeding available RAM
- Partitioning strategies based on data access patterns
- Query optimization for partitioned data with predicate pushdown
- Memory usage monitoring with automatic cleanup of unused query results
- Progress indicators for long-running analytical operations

### Error Handling and Resource Management
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#enhancement-specific-standards]

**DuckDB Operations Error Handling:**
- DuckDB operations wrapped with proper error handling and resource management
- Connection pooling with automatic connection cleanup
- Query timeout handling for long-running operations

- Resource leak prevention with proper connection and memory management

### Integration Points with Existing System
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#critical-integration-rules]

**Agent Workflow Integration:**
- Direct integration with existing agent workflow patterns
- Template engine integration for query templates
- Natural language workflow processing for analytical operations
- Progress indication using existing BMad patterns (ora, chalk)
