## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 1.1 established the expansion pack directory structure and agent definitions. Story 1.1.5 implemented the security foundation including API key authentication and feature flags. This story builds on that foundation by implementing the first data processing component - the DataIngestionService with proper security integration.

### DataIngestionService Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#dataingestionservice]

**Responsibility:** Manages PyAirbyte connector execution, data source discovery, and initial data validation for diverse input sources

**Key Interfaces Required:**
- REST API endpoints for file upload and database connection configuration
- PyAirbyte subprocess execution with JSON communication protocols
- DuckDB connection interface for data loading and validation (interface only, DuckDB implementation in Story 1.3)
- YAML configuration interface following existing technical-preferences patterns

**Technology Stack Dependencies:**
- Node.js with Python subprocess execution
- PyAirbyte ^0.20.0 (Python package)
- Connection pooling for database sources
- Existing Components: CLI framework (commander), file system utilities (fs-extra), configuration management (js-yaml)

### API Design Requirements
[Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md#data-source-management]

**POST /api/v1/data-sources Endpoint:**
- Purpose: Create and configure new data source connections for PyAirbyte ingestion
- Integration: Extends existing CLI tool patterns, stores configuration in YAML following technical-preferences structure
- Authentication: Requires API key with 'data_write' scope from Story 1.1.5 security framework
- Feature Flag: Controlled by 'pyairbyte_integration' flag in feature-flags.yaml
- Versioning: API versioning through URL path (`/api/v1/`) for backward compatibility
- Security: All data operations logged through security-logger.js

### Python Integration Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#enhancement-specific-standards]

**Python Code Integration Standards:**
- All Python code executed through Node.js subprocess interfaces
- Python scripts follow PEP 8 standards with black formatting
- Virtual environment isolation with pinned dependency versions

**Error Handling Integration:**
- Python subprocess errors wrapped and translated to Node.js error objects
- Graceful degradation when data tools unavailable with clear user messaging
- All data processing errors use existing BMad error patterns with chalk styling

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#new-file-organization]

**New Files to Create:**
```plaintext
tools/
├── data-services/           # NEW: Data processing services
│   ├── data-ingestion-service.js
│   ├── pyairbyte-wrapper.js
│   └── connection-manager.js
├── lib/                     # Enhanced shared utilities
│   └── python-subprocess.js # NEW: Python process management
requirements.txt             # NEW: Python dependencies
.python-version             # NEW: Python version specification
```

### PyAirbyte Technical Details
[Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md#new-technology-additions]

**PyAirbyte Version:** ^0.20.0  
**Purpose:** Flexible data ingestion  
**Rationale:** Major version update with improved caching and stream selection capabilities  
**Integration Method:** Python subprocess with JSON communication

**Key Capabilities to Implement:**
- Stream selection for selective data loading
- Cache management with connectivity to various sources
- Python-native integration with DataFrame libraries
- Connector architecture for diverse data sources

### Configuration Management
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#enhancement-specific-standards]

**Configuration Management Standards:**
- All data tool configurations stored in YAML following existing technical-preferences patterns
- Environment-specific settings isolated in separate configuration files
- Sensitive credentials encrypted using existing BMad security patterns

**Example Configuration Structure:**
```yaml
dataIngestion:
  pyairbyte:
    version: "^0.20.0"
    cacheLocation: ".cache/pyairbyte"
    maxCacheSize: "1GB"
  connectors:
    csv:
      enabled: true
      maxFileSize: "100MB"
    json:
      enabled: true
      maxNestingDepth: 10
    databases:
      postgresql:
        enabled: true
        poolSize: 5
      mysql:
        enabled: true
        poolSize: 5
```

### Memory and Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#dataingestionservice]

**Performance Constraints:**
- PyAirbyte subprocess execution with JSON communication protocols
- Connection pooling for efficient database access
- Memory management for large file ingestion
- Non-blocking Node.js event loop during Python subprocess execution

### Integration Points with Existing System
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#critical-integration-rules]

**Existing API Compatibility:** All existing BMad-Method CLI commands must remain completely unchanged - new functionality is purely additive through expansion pack patterns

**CLI Integration Requirements:**
- Extend existing commander.js patterns for new data commands
- Follow existing tools/ directory organization patterns
- Maintain existing YAML configuration loading via yaml-utils.js
- Use existing fs-extra patterns for file operations

## Testing

### Testing Standards from Architecture
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#new-testing-requirements]

**Framework:** Jest ^30.0.4 extended with Python subprocess testing utilities  
**Test Location:** `/tests/data-services/` following existing test organization patterns  
**Coverage Target:** 80% minimum coverage for all data processing components

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Python subprocess communication testing
- PyAirbyte connector validation testing  
- API endpoint integration testing
- Memory usage monitoring during ingestion

**Integration Testing Scope:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#integration-tests]
- Python-Node.js interoperability testing
- Cross-component data flow validation
- Existing System Verification: All existing BMad-Method functionality must continue working unchanged

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Large file ingestion without memory overflow

- Existing CLI tools continue functioning during data operations
- Cache management and invalidation workflows
- API key validation and scope enforcement
- Feature flag enable/disable behavior
