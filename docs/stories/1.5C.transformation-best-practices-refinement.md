# Story 1.5C: Transformation Best Practices - Agent Pattern Refinement

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** data engineering agent,
**I want** refined best practice patterns for SQLmesh transformations,
**so that** I can provide optimal guidance for cost-effective, error-free model development.

## Context Summary
This story builds on successful SQLmesh implementation (Stories 1.4, 1.5A, 1.5B) to capture and systematize best practices discovered during development. The goal is to embed this knowledge into agent decision-making to improve future transformation projects and reduce the learning curve for teams adopting SQLmesh patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Create agent guidance patterns for cost optimization strategies
3. Establish blue-green deployment workflow patterns for agents
4. Define embedded documentation standards for SQLmesh models
5. Create Python + SQL model coordination patterns
6. Establish transformation engine selection logic for agents

## Integration Verification & Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

- **IV2**: Best practice patterns reduce development errors by 30% (measured by deployment failure rate)
- **IV3**: Cost optimization strategies demonstrate 15%+ measurable warehouse cost savings
- **IV4**: Blue-green deployment patterns prevent 90%+ of production issues (zero-downtime deployments)
