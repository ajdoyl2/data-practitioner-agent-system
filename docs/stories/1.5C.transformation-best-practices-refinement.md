# Story 1.5C: Transformation Best Practices - Agent Pattern Refinement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** data engineering agent,
**I want** refined best practice patterns for SQLmesh transformations,
**so that** I can provide optimal guidance for cost-effective, error-free model development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Document SQLmesh vs dbt decision criteria for agent recommendations
2. Create agent guidance patterns for cost optimization strategies
3. Establish blue-green deployment workflow patterns for agents
4. Define embedded documentation standards for SQLmesh models
5. Create Python + SQL model coordination patterns
6. Establish transformation engine selection logic for agents

## Integration Verification

## Dev Notes

### Agent Pattern Refinement Goals
This story focuses on capturing best practices discovered during SQLmesh implementation to improve agent guidance and decision-making for future transformation workflows.

### Key Areas for Pattern Development
- **Decision Logic**: When agents should recommend SQLmesh vs dbt vs dual-engine
- **Cost Optimization**: How agents can guide users toward cost-effective strategies
- **Deployment Safety**: Patterns for preventing production errors through blue-green deployment
- **Documentation Quality**: Embedded documentation standards that reduce maintenance overhead
- **Multi-Language Models**: Best practices for coordinating SQL and Python models

### Agent Enhancement Targets
- **data-engineer agent**: Enhanced with SQLmesh-specific guidance
- **data-architect agent**: Cost optimization and deployment strategy patterns
- **data-qa-engineer agent**: Blue-green deployment validation patterns
- **General agents**: Transformation engine selection logic

### Testing Standards
- **Documentation Quality**: Validate that patterns improve agent recommendations
- **Decision Logic**: Test agent selection criteria with various scenarios
- **Best Practice Validation**: Ensure patterns lead to measurable improvements
