### Layered Architecture Implementation
**ELT Modeling Structure:**
- **Source Layer**: Raw data from PyAirbyte ingestion, registered as dbt sources
- **Staging Layer**: One-to-one with source tables, basic cleansing and type casting
- **Intermediate Layer**: Business logic transformations, joins, and aggregations
- **Marts Layer**: Final analytics-ready datasets for consumption

**Model Naming Conventions:**
- Staging: `stg_[source_name]__[table_name]`
- Intermediate: `int_[business_concept]__[description]`
- Marts: `[business_area]__[entity_type]` (e.g., `sales__customer_metrics`)

### Testing Framework Implementation
**Generic Test Configuration:**
- unique: Ensure column values are unique
- not_null: Ensure column values are not null
- accepted_values: Validate column values against allowed list
- relationships: Validate foreign key relationships

**Custom Test Patterns:**
- Data quality thresholds (completeness, accuracy, consistency)
- Business rule validation (e.g., positive revenue amounts)
- Statistical outlier detection
- Cross-table consistency checks

### Python Integration Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#enhancement-specific-standards]

**Python Code Integration Standards:**
- All dbt commands executed through Node.js subprocess interfaces
- dbt project follows standard conventions with DuckDB adapter
- Virtual environment isolation with pinned dependency versions
- Error handling with proper subprocess management

**dbt Command Execution Patterns:**
```javascript
// Example dbt subprocess execution pattern
const dbtRun = async (models = null, fullRefresh = false) => {
  const args = ['run'];
  if (models) args.push('--models', models);
  if (fullRefresh) args.push('--full-refresh');
  
  return await executeDbtCommand(args);
};
```

### Integration with BMad Template System
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#transformationengine]

**Guided ELT Modeling Templates:**
- Integration with BMad template system for guided ELT workflows
- Elicitation patterns for model generation and configuration
- Template-driven model creation with validation
- Interactive workflows for transformation design

### Performance and Quality Requirements
**Data Quality Framework:**
- Automated test generation based on model schemas and business rules
- Comprehensive testing patterns with 80% minimum coverage
- Test result parsing and integration with BMad validation systems
- Performance monitoring for transformation execution times

**Transformation Optimization:**
- Incremental model support for large datasets
- Query optimization recommendations based on DuckDB capabilities
- Resource usage monitoring and optimization suggestions
- Selective model execution for development efficiency

### Error Handling and Process Management
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#enhancement-specific-standards]

**dbt Operations Error Handling:**
- Python subprocess errors wrapped and translated to Node.js error objects
- Comprehensive error handling for dbt compilation, testing, and execution failures
- Graceful degradation when dbt tools unavailable with clear user messaging
- Process timeout handling for long-running transformations

### Integration Points with Existing System
[Source: architecture/coding-standards-and-conventions.md#critical-integration-rules]

**Existing API Compatibility:** All existing BMad-Method validation scripts and build processes must remain completely unchanged - dbt operations are isolated within the data processing pipeline

**BMad Integration Requirements:**
- Follow existing task execution patterns for transformation workflows
- Integrate with template engine for guided modeling workflows
- Use existing validation systems for transformation quality gates
- Maintain existing progress tracking patterns (ora, chalk)
