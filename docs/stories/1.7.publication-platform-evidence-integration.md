## Appendix
{{technical_details}}
```

### Automated Narrative Generation
**LLM Integration for Publication Quality:**
```javascript
// Narrative generation workflow
class NarrativeGenerator {
  async generateInsightNarrative(analysisResults, style = 'pew-research') {
    const prompt = this.buildNarrativePrompt(analysisResults, style);
    const narrative = await this.llmProvider.generate(prompt);
    
    return {
      executive_summary: this.extractSummary(narrative),
      key_findings: this.extractFindings(narrative),
      methodology: this.extractMethodology(narrative),
      statistical_interpretation: this.extractInterpretation(narrative)
    };
  }
  
  buildNarrativePrompt(results, style) {
    return `Generate a ${style} publication narrative for the following analysis results:
    
    Statistical Results: ${JSON.stringify(results.statistics)}
    Hypothesis Results: ${JSON.stringify(results.hypotheses)}
    Pattern Detection: ${JSON.stringify(results.patterns)}
    
    Requirements:
    - Professional, accessible language
    - Clear statistical interpretation
    - Business impact context
    - Actionable insights`;
  }
}
```

### Integration with BMad Web-Builder
**Build System Integration:**
```javascript
// Evidence.dev builder integration
class EvidenceBuilder {
  constructor() {
    this.evidenceConfig = this.loadEvidenceConfig();
  }
  
  async buildPublication(analysisProject) {
    // Generate Evidence.dev site
    const siteConfig = await this.generateSiteConfig(analysisProject);
    const evidenceBuild = await this.executeEvidenceBuild(siteConfig);
    
    // Integrate with existing BMad web-builder
    return await this.integrateWithBMadBuilder(evidenceBuild);
  }
  
  integrateWithBMadBuilder(evidenceBuild) {
    // Extend existing web-builder patterns
    // Maintain separation from agent bundling workflows
    // Add Evidence.dev sites as separate build targets
  }
}
```

### Deployment and Hosting Options

- Data source connectivity failure handling
- Narrative generation error recovery with fallback content
- Build process timeout handling and retry mechanisms
- Version rollback capabilities for failed deployments

## Developer Implementation Guide

### Task Priority Matrix
**CRITICAL PATH (Week 1) - Must Complete First:**
- Task 1: Evidence.dev setup (blocks everything else)
- Task 3: Universal SQL integration (blocks data access for all features)

**PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT (Week 2) - Can Work Simultaneously:**
- Task 2: PublicationEngine + Task 4: Templates (complementary development)
- Task 7: Visualization components (independent of narrative generation)

**FINAL INTEGRATION (Week 3) - Requires Previous Tasks:**
- Task 5: Narrative generation + Task 6: Deployment (requires working templates)
- Task 8: Dagster integration + Task 9: Testing (final validation phase)

### Implementation Decision Boundaries

**Dev Agent Autonomy (No consultation needed):**
- LLM provider choice (OpenAI, Anthropic, local) for narrative generation
- Specific CSS frameworks for publication styling within Evidence.dev ecosystem
- Chart library selection (D3, Observable, Evidence.dev native components)
- Directory structure variations within specified patterns
- SQL query optimization approaches for performance
- Error handling implementation details

**Requires Stakeholder Input:**
- Publication template branding and visual identity decisions
- Deployment platform final selection (Evidence Cloud vs. self-hosted)
- Data privacy and access control requirements specification
- Publication approval workflows and review processes
- Performance threshold adjustments beyond specified minimums

### Known Risk Mitigation

**HIGH PROBABILITY RISKS:**
1. **Evidence.dev Learning Curve** (90% probability)
   - **Mitigation**: Start with basic site generation, iterate complexity gradually
   - **Fallback**: Static site generation with manual SQL embedding if Evidence.dev blocks progress
   - **Time Buffer**: Add +2 days to Task 1 timeline
   - **Early Warning**: If basic site not working within first day, escalate immediately

2. **Universal SQL Performance** (70% probability)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement query optimization patterns from day 1, test with realistic datasets
   - **Fallback**: Pre-computed result caching with scheduled refresh if real-time queries too slow
   - **Performance Baseline**: Must handle 1M+ record datasets with <3s page load
   - **Monitoring**: Set up performance alerts during development, not just production

3. **Narrative Generation Quality** (60% probability)
   - **Mitigation**: Template-driven generation with human review workflows built-in
   - **Fallback**: Template-only approach without LLM if quality insufficient
   - **Quality Gate**: Statistical accuracy validation required - narratives must match underlying data
   - **Review Process**: Implement staged rollout with quality checkpoints

### Implementation Sequence Validation

**Before Starting Task 2 (PublicationEngine):**
- ✓ Evidence.dev builds successfully with test data
- ✓ Universal SQL connects and queries test datasets
- ✓ Basic template renders without errors
