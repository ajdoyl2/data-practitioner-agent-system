# Transformation Engine Decision Matrix

## Overview

This decision matrix provides agent guidance for selecting the optimal transformation engine (SQLmesh vs dbt vs dual-engine) based on project characteristics, requirements, and constraints.

## Decision Factors

### Primary Decision Criteria

| Factor | SQLmesh | dbt | Dual-Engine | Weight |
|--------|---------|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Cost Optimization Priority** | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Good | 25% |
| **Blue-Green Deployment Need** | ✅ Native | ❌ Manual | ✅ Selective | 20% |
| **Team dbt Experience** | ❌ Learning curve | ✅ Leverage existing | ✅ Gradual transition | 15% |
| **Project Complexity** | ✅ Handles complex | ✅ Mature patterns | ✅ Best of both | 15% |
| **Virtual Environment Benefits** | ✅ Full support | ❌ Limited | ✅ Selective | 10% |
| **Ecosystem Maturity** | ⚠️ Growing | ✅ Mature | ✅ Leverages both | 10% |
| **Python Integration** | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Flexible | 5% |

### Secondary Considerations

| Factor | SQLmesh | dbt | Dual-Engine |
|--------|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Learning Investment** | High | Low | Medium |
| **Community Support** | Growing | Extensive | Variable |
| **Tool Integration** | Modern stack | Legacy-friendly | Flexible |
| **Maintenance Overhead** | Low | Medium | Medium-High |

## Decision Tree

### Scenario 1: Cost-Sensitive Projects
**Threshold**: Warehouse costs >$10K/month or tight budget constraints
- **Primary Choice**: SQLmesh (native cost optimization)
- **Alternative**: Dual-engine (SQLmesh for expensive models, dbt for simple)
- **Avoid**: Pure dbt (limited cost controls)

### Scenario 2: Production-Critical Systems
**Threshold**: Zero-downtime requirements or high-availability needs
- **Primary Choice**: SQLmesh (blue-green deployment)
- **Alternative**: Dual-engine (SQLmesh for critical paths)
- **Avoid**: Pure dbt (deployment risks)

### Scenario 3: Existing dbt Investment
**Threshold**: >50 existing dbt models or team expertise
- **Primary Choice**: Dual-engine (preserve investment, add SQLmesh benefits)
- **Alternative**: dbt (if cost/deployment not critical)
- **Avoid**: Pure SQLmesh migration (high disruption)

### Scenario 4: Greenfield Projects
**Threshold**: New data platform or minimal legacy constraints
- **Primary Choice**: SQLmesh (modern approach, full benefits)
- **Alternative**: Dual-engine (future flexibility)
- **Consider**: dbt (if team prefers familiar tools)

### Scenario 5: Complex Python Integration
**Threshold**: Heavy custom logic or ML model integration
- **Primary Choice**: SQLmesh (native Python support)
- **Alternative**: Dual-engine (SQLmesh for Python models)
- **Avoid**: Pure dbt (limited Python capabilities)

## Agent Recommendation Algorithm

### Scoring System

```python
def calculate_engine_score(project_characteristics):
    scores = {
        'sqlmesh': 0,
        'dbt': 0,
        'dual_engine': 0
    }
    
    # Cost optimization factor (25% weight)
    if project_characteristics.monthly_warehouse_cost > 10000:
        scores['sqlmesh'] += 25
        scores['dual_engine'] += 15
    
    # Blue-green deployment factor (20% weight)
    if project_characteristics.zero_downtime_required:
        scores['sqlmesh'] += 20
        scores['dual_engine'] += 15
    
    # Team experience factor (15% weight)
    if project_characteristics.team_dbt_experience > 6:  # months
        scores['dbt'] += 15
        scores['dual_engine'] += 10
    
    # Complexity factor (15% weight)
    if project_characteristics.model_count > 100:
        scores['sqlmesh'] += 10
        scores['dual_engine'] += 15
        scores['dbt'] += 8
    
    # Virtual environment benefits (10% weight)
    if project_characteristics.needs_isolation:
        scores['sqlmesh'] += 10
        scores['dual_engine'] += 8
    
    # Ecosystem maturity (10% weight)
    if project_characteristics.requires_stability:
        scores['dbt'] += 10
        scores['dual_engine'] += 8
    
    # Python integration (5% weight)
    if project_characteristics.python_models > 10:
        scores['sqlmesh'] += 5
        scores['dual_engine'] += 3
    
    return scores

def recommend_engine(scores):
    max_score = max(scores.values())
    if max_score < 40:
        return "dbt", "Default choice for standard requirements"
    
    recommendation = max(scores, key=scores.get)
    confidence = max_score / 100
    
    return recommendation, f"Confidence: {confidence:.0%}"
```

### Confidence Thresholds

- **High Confidence (>70%)**: Clear recommendation, proceed with chosen engine
- **Medium Confidence (50-70%)**: Recommend dual-engine approach for flexibility
- **Low Confidence (<50%)**: Default to dbt with SQLmesh evaluation

## Migration Considerations

### From dbt to SQLmesh
1. **Assessment Phase**: Evaluate model complexity and team readiness
2. **Pilot Phase**: Start with 5-10 high-value models
3. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate models by priority/complexity
4. **Validation Phase**: Compare performance and cost metrics

### Dual-Engine Implementation
1. **Engine Selection Rules**: Define clear criteria for each engine
2. **Dependency Management**: Handle cross-engine dependencies
3. **Deployment Coordination**: Orchestrate dual-engine deployments
4. **Monitoring Strategy**: Track performance across both engines

## Success Metrics

### Cost Optimization
- **Target**: 15%+ reduction in warehouse costs
- **Measurement**: Monthly cost comparison pre/post implementation
- **Timeframe**: 3-month evaluation period

### Deployment Safety
- **Target**: 90%+ zero-downtime deployments
- **Measurement**: Deployment failure rate tracking
- **Timeframe**: Continuous monitoring

### Team Efficiency
- **Target**: 25% improvement in development velocity
- **Measurement**: Story point completion rates
- **Timeframe**: Sprint-over-sprint comparison
