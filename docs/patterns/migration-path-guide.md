# Migration Path Guide: dbt to SQLmesh Transformation

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive migration strategies for teams transitioning from dbt to SQLmesh, including risk mitigation, timeline planning, and success validation approaches.

## Migration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Direct Migration (Greenfield Mindset)
**Best For**: Small teams (<10 models), new projects, minimal dbt investment
**Timeline**: 2-6 weeks
**Risk Level**: Medium

#### Approach
1. **Complete Replacement**: Migrate all models to SQLmesh
2. **Clean Slate**: Redesign models using SQLmesh best practices
3. **Full Training**: Team learns SQLmesh from ground up

#### Pros
- Maximize SQLmesh benefits immediately
- Simplified architecture (single engine)
- Clean, optimized implementation

#### Cons
- Higher initial disruption
- Requires complete team retraining
- Loss of dbt-specific optimizations

### Strategy 2: Gradual Migration (Risk-Mitigated)
**Best For**: Medium teams (10-50 models), production systems, risk-averse environments
**Timeline**: 3-6 months
**Risk Level**: Low

#### Approach
1. **Phased Replacement**: Migrate models incrementally
2. **Value-Based Prioritization**: Start with high-value, low-risk models
3. **Parallel Operation**: Run both engines during transition

#### Pros
- Minimal production risk
- Gradual team learning
- Ability to validate benefits incrementally

#### Cons
- Extended complexity period
- Resource overhead for dual systems
- Longer timeline to full benefits

### Strategy 3: Dual-Engine (Permanent Hybrid)
**Best For**: Large teams (>50 models), extensive dbt investment, mixed requirements
**Timeline**: 2-4 months setup, ongoing maintenance
**Risk Level**: Low

#### Approach
1. **Strategic Selection**: Use optimal engine for each use case
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Define rules for engine selection
3. **Coordinated Operations**: Manage dependencies across engines

#### Pros
- Preserve existing dbt investment
- Leverage best of both engines
- Flexible model placement

#### Cons
- Ongoing complexity
- Dual maintenance overhead
- Team skill requirements for both engines

## Migration Planning Framework

        'infrastructure_maturity': 0,
        'business_drivers': 0
    }
    
    # Model complexity (25% weight)
    if assessment['model_count'] < 25:
        scores['model_complexity'] = 80
    elif assessment['model_count'] < 100:
        scores['model_complexity'] = 60
    else:
        scores['model_complexity'] = 40
    
    # Team readiness (25% weight)
    if assessment['python_skills'] > 3:  # 1-5 scale
        scores['team_readiness'] = 80
    else:
        scores['team_readiness'] = 60
    
    # Infrastructure maturity (25% weight)
    if assessment['ci_cd_maturity'] > 3:  # 1-5 scale
        scores['infrastructure_maturity'] = 80
    else:
        scores['infrastructure_maturity'] = 60
    
    # Business drivers (25% weight)
    cost_driver = min(assessment['monthly_warehouse_cost'] / 10000, 1) * 50
    downtime_driver = 50 if assessment['zero_downtime_required'] else 20
    scores['business_drivers'] = cost_driver + downtime_driver
    
    overall_score = sum(scores.values()) / 4
    return overall_score, scores
```

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (2-4 weeks)
