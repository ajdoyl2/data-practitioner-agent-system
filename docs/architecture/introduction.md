# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing BMad-Method with a comprehensive Data Practitioner expansion pack. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of data analysis capabilities while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing BMad-Method architecture by defining how new data processing components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** BMad-Method framework - Node.js-based system for orchestrating AI agents in agile development
- **Current Tech Stack:** Node.js >=20.0.0, YAML/Markdown-based agent definitions, CLI tools for processing and bundling
- **Architecture Style:** Natural language framework with modular expansion pack architecture
- **Deployment Method:** NPM package distribution with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

### Available Documentation
- Complete project analysis available from document-project output
- Tech Stack Documentation (Node.js >=20.0.0, commander, fs-extra, js-yaml, etc.)
- Source Tree/Architecture (bmad-core structure with agents, tasks, templates)
- API Documentation (Agent command APIs via YAML configuration)
- Technical Debt Documentation (Configuration complexity, dual environment maintenance)

### Identified Constraints
- Must maintain Node.js >=20.0.0 runtime compatibility
- Natural language framework philosophy must be preserved
- Expansion pack architecture patterns must be followed
- Zero impact on existing BMad-Method functionality
- File-based storage approach must be maintained for configurations
