# Security Integration

## Existing Security Measures

**Authentication:** Configuration-based authentication through technical-preferences.md patterns, no centralized authentication system - relies on local environment security  
**Authorization:** File-system based permissions following standard Unix patterns, agent access controlled through YAML configuration schemas  
**Data Protection:** Sensitive configuration data encrypted using existing BMad patterns, local-first approach minimizes data exposure risks  
**Security Tools:** NPM audit for dependency scanning, GitHub security advisories integration, Prettier and semantic-release for supply chain security

## Enhancement Security Requirements

**New Security Measures:** Python dependency vulnerability scanning through pip-audit and safety, database encryption at rest for DuckDB files, secure credential management for external API connections, network security for Evidence.dev publication endpoints

**Integration Points:** PyAirbyte connection strings encrypted using existing technical-preferences encryption patterns, DuckDB database files protected with file system permissions matching existing BMad security model, Dagster web UI access restricted to localhost with optional authentication, LLM API keys managed through existing secure configuration mechanisms

**Compliance Requirements:** Data processing workflows maintain GDPR compliance through local-first processing, audit logging for all data operations following existing BMad logging patterns, secure deletion procedures for temporary data files, privacy protection through configurable data anonymization

## Security Testing

**Existing Security Tests:** Enhanced NPM audit integration with automated dependency vulnerability scanning, GitHub security advisory monitoring with automated alerts  
**New Security Test Requirements:** Python dependency vulnerability scanning using pip-audit and safety tools, database security testing with encryption validation, API endpoint security testing with penetration testing simulation, data anonymization validation with privacy impact assessment  
**Penetration Testing:** Automated security testing integrated into CI/CD pipeline, third-party security assessment recommended for production deployments, regular security updates and vulnerability patching procedures
