# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

Please begin implementation of the Data Practitioner Agent System expansion pack using the completed architecture document at `docs/architecture.md` and PRD at `docs/prd.md`. 

**Key Integration Requirements Validated:**
- BMad-Method expansion pack patterns must be followed exactly (agents/, templates/, tasks/, checklists/, data/ structure)
- Python tools integrated through Node.js subprocess execution to maintain framework consistency
- DuckDB operates as embedded analytics engine without impacting existing file-based storage
- All existing BMad functionality must remain completely unchanged - this is purely additive

**Existing System Constraints Based on Project Analysis:**
- Node.js >=20.0.0 runtime requirement maintained
- YAML-based agent definitions with natural language workflows preserved
- CLI tool patterns extended, never modified
- Web-builder functionality enhanced with new data tool bundling capabilities

**First Story to Implement:** Story 1.1 - Foundation (Data Agent Infrastructure Setup)
- Create `/bmad-data-practitioner/` expansion pack directory structure
- Implement 6 data agent definitions following existing YAML schema patterns
- Integrate with existing installer and web-builder tools
- **Critical Integration Checkpoint:** Validate existing agents continue functioning unchanged

**Maintaining System Integrity:** Each story must include Integration Verification steps to ensure existing BMad-Method functionality remains intact throughout implementation. No story should be marked complete without validating IV1, IV2, and IV3 requirements.

## Developer Handoff

Begin implementing the Data Practitioner expansion pack following the architecture at `docs/architecture.md` and existing BMad-Method coding standards analyzed from the project structure.

**Integration Requirements with Existing Codebase:**
- Follow established expansion pack patterns seen in `expansion-packs/bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/` and `expansion-packs/bmad-infrastructure-devops/`
- All Python tool integration must use subprocess execution with proper error handling
- Extend existing CLI patterns in `tools/` directory without modifying core functionality
- Use existing YAML configuration patterns from `core-config.yaml` and `technical-preferences.md`

**Key Technical Decisions Based on Project Constraints:**
- DuckDB embedded approach maintains BMad-Method's simplicity philosophy
- PyAirbyte, dbt-core, Dagster executed through Python subprocess interfaces
- Evidence.dev integrated through existing web-builder patterns
- Virtual environment isolation prevents dependency conflicts

**Existing System Compatibility Requirements with Verification Steps:**
- **Pre-Implementation:** Run `npm run validate` to establish baseline functionality
- **During Development:** Each component must pass integration tests with existing system
- **Post-Implementation:** All existing CLI commands, agent workflows, and build processes must function identically
- **Performance Validation:** No degradation in existing BMad-Method response times

**Clear Implementation Sequencing:**
1. **Foundation Phase:** Expansion pack structure and agent definitions (Week 1-2)
2. **Data Ingestion:** PyAirbyte integration with Node.js wrappers (Week 3-4)  
3. **Analytics Engine:** DuckDB integration with memory management (Week 5-6)
4. **Transformation:** dbt-core workflows with guided templates (Week 7-8)
5. **Orchestration:** Dagster pipeline coordination (Week 9-10)
6. **Analysis:** Automated EDA and hypothesis generation (Week 11-12)
7. **Publication:** Evidence.dev integration and site generation (Week 13-14)
8. **Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive testing and documentation (Week 15-16)
