# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview
**Enhancement Type:** Integration with New Systems + Major Feature Modification + New Infrastructure  
**Scope:** Comprehensive data practitioner expansion pack with 6 specialized agents, modern data stack integration (PyAirbyte, DuckDB, dbt-core, Dagster, Evidence.dev), and publication-quality insight generation  
**Integration Impact:** Significant - Introduces Python ecosystem dependencies while maintaining full compatibility with existing Node.js infrastructure

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** Follow established expansion pack patterns - create `/bmad-data-practitioner/` directory with standard subdirectories (agents/, templates/, tasks/, checklists/, data/). All new agents follow existing YAML-based definition patterns with natural language workflows.

**Database Integration:** Introduce DuckDB as embedded analytical database operating alongside existing file-based YAML/Markdown storage. No changes to existing data persistence - DuckDB handles only data processing workloads while framework configurations remain in files.

**API Integration:** Add new REST and WebSocket endpoints for data ingestion under existing `tools/` directory structure. PyAirbyte connectors wrapped in Node.js interfaces to maintain framework consistency and preserve existing CLI tool patterns.

**UI Integration:** Evidence.dev operates as separate static site generator consuming data pipeline outputs. Integration through existing `web-builder.js` patterns with new build targets for publication sites, maintaining separation from agent bundling workflows.

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** All existing agent commands, CLI tools, and web-builder functionality remains unchanged. New data ingestion APIs added as separate endpoints without modifying existing interfaces.
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** No existing "database schema" to maintain (file-based storage). DuckDB operates in isolation for data processing only, with no impact on YAML/Markdown file structures.
- **UI/UX Consistency:** New data agents follow identical interaction patterns to existing agents. Evidence.dev publications maintain separate UI space, accessed through new commands but not interfering with existing web bundle generation.
- **Performance Impact:** Data processing operations isolated in separate processes/subprocesses to prevent blocking existing Node.js event loop. Memory usage managed through configurable DuckDB limits and automatic spilling strategies.
