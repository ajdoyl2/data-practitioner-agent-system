# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure

**Current Deployment:** NPM package distribution with semantic-release automation, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated versioning and publishing  
**Infrastructure Tools:** GitHub Actions workflows, semantic-release for automated versioning, NPM registry for package distribution  
**Environments:** Development (local), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Production (NPM registry), User installations (various local environments)

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Extended NPM package distribution with multi-runtime support - maintains existing Node.js package structure while adding Python environment management and data tool orchestration

**Infrastructure Changes:**
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflows to include Python dependency validation and testing
- Added Python virtual environment creation and management during installation process
- DuckDB database initialization and configuration during expansion pack setup
- Evidence.dev build integration with existing web-builder deployment patterns

**Pipeline Integration:** Pre-existing semantic-release workflow extended with Python tool version validation, enhanced installer process includes Python runtime detection and virtual environment setup, build process enhanced to validate data tool dependencies.

## Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Modular component rollback with dependency isolation - individual data components can be disabled without affecting core BMad-Method functionality

**Risk Mitigation:** All data processing components isolated in separate processes to prevent core system impact, database operations use transaction-based approaches with automatic rollback on failure, configuration-driven feature toggles allow selective component disabling.

**Monitoring Integration:** Existing BMad CLI progress indication extended with data pipeline monitoring, Dagster web UI integration provides comprehensive pipeline observability, health check endpoints for all data services with automatic recovery procedures.
