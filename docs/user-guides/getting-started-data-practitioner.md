        c.email,
        c.signup_date,
        c.subscription_tier,
        c.country,
        c.age_group,
        COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
        COALESCE(SUM(o.amount), 0) as total_spent,
        COALESCE(AVG(o.amount), 0) as avg_order_value,
        MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date,
        DATEDIFF('day', c.signup_date, CURRENT_DATE) as days_since_signup
    FROM staging_customers c
    LEFT JOIN staging_orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.email, c.signup_date, 
             c.subscription_tier, c.country, c.age_group
)

SELECT *,
    CASE 
        WHEN total_orders >= 5 THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN total_orders >= 2 THEN 'Medium Value'
        ELSE 'Low Value'
    END as customer_segment,
    
    CASE 
        WHEN days_since_signup <= 30 THEN 'New'
        WHEN days_since_signup <= 90 THEN 'Recent'
        ELSE 'Established'
    END as customer_lifecycle
FROM customer_orders
EOF

echo "✅ SQLmesh transformation models created"
```

#### Step 5: Create Evidence.dev Dashboard

```bash
# Create Evidence.dev project structure

/BMad:agents:data-analyst

# Commands:
# *analyze-data (perform exploratory analysis)
# *generate-insights (create business insights)
# *validate-results (verify analytical outputs)
```

#### Step 7: Validate Complete Pipeline

**Final validation commands:**

```bash
# Test DuckDB integration
python -c "
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')
conn.execute('CREATE VIEW customers AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(\"customer-analytics-project/data/raw/customers.csv\")')
conn.execute('CREATE VIEW orders AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto(\"customer-analytics-project/data/raw/orders.csv\")')
result = conn.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers').fetchone()
print(f'✅ Customer records loaded: {result[0]}')
result = conn.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders').fetchone()
print(f'✅ Order records loaded: {result[0]}')
"

# Validate SQLmesh models exist
ls -la customer-analytics-project/sqlmesh-project/models/
echo "✅ All SQLmesh models created"

# Check Evidence.dev dashboard
ls -la customer-analytics-project/evidence-project/pages/executive-dashboard.md
echo "✅ Evidence.dev dashboard ready"

# Test agent responsiveness
echo "All agents should be responsive to *help commands"
```

**🎉 SUCCESS!** You now have a complete, production-ready customer analytics pipeline built with Data Practitioner agents!

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Issue 1: Python Virtual Environment Problems

**Symptom:** `pip install` fails or packages not found

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Verify virtual environment is activated
which python
# Should show path to venv/bin/python

# Recreate virtual environment if corrupted
deactivate
rm -rf venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue 2: Node.js + Python Subprocess Communication

**Symptom:** Agent commands fail with subprocess errors

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Verify Python executable path
which python
# Update config if needed

# Test subprocess communication
node -e "
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const python = spawn('python', ['-c', 'print(\"✅ Subprocess working\")']);
python.stdout.on('data', (data) => console.log(data.toString()));
python.on('close', (code) => console.log('Exit code:', code));
"
```

### Issue 3: DuckDB Memory Issues

**Symptom:** Out of memory errors with large datasets

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Configure DuckDB memory limits
python -c "
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')
conn.execute('SET memory_limit = \"1GB\"')
conn.execute('SET max_memory = \"1GB\"')
print('✅ Memory limits configured')
"

# Use file-based database for large datasets
python -c "
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect('data/analytics.duckdb')
# File-based database handles larger datasets better
"
```

### Issue 4: Agent Activation Failures

**Symptom:** Agent doesn't respond or activate incorrectly

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Verify expansion pack is properly installed
npx bmad-method list-agents | grep "data-"

# Check agent file exists
ls -la bmad-method/expansion-packs/bmad-data-practitioner/agents/

# Reinstall expansion pack if needed
npm run install:bmad
```

### Issue 5: Port Conflicts (Dagster, Evidence.dev)

**Symptom:** "Port already in use" errors

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check what's using ports
lsof -i :3000  # Evidence.dev default
lsof -i :3001  # Dagster UI default

# Kill processes if needed
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)

# Configure different ports
export DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_PORT=3002
export EVIDENCE_PORT=3003
```
