# Epic 1: Data Practitioner Agent System Expansion Pack Integration

**Epic Goal**: Integrate a comprehensive data practitioner expansion pack into BMad-Method, enabling autonomous data analysis workflows through specialized agents, modern data stack tools integration (PyAirbyte, DuckDB, dbt-core, Dagster, Evidence.dev), and publication-quality insight generation.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Maintain full compatibility with existing BMad-Method infrastructure
- Preserve natural language framework philosophy 
- Support two-phase workflow (Planning/Development)
- Enable incremental value delivery through milestone-based stories
- Ensure no disruption to existing framework functionality

## Story 1.1: Foundation - Data Agent Infrastructure Setup

As a **BMad-Method developer**,
I want to establish the data practitioner expansion pack structure with core agent definitions,
so that the framework can support data analysis workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create bmad-data-practitioner/ directory structure following expansion pack patterns
2. Implement 6 data agent definitions (data-product-manager, data-architect, data-engineer, data-analyst, ml-engineer, data-qa-engineer) with YAML configurations
3. Create base templates for data workflows (data-requirements-prd, data-architecture-doc)
4. Integrate expansion pack with existing installer and web-builder tools
5. Validate agents load correctly in both IDE and web environments

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing agents and workflows continue functioning without modification
- IV2: Web-builder successfully bundles new data agents alongside existing agents
- IV3: No performance degradation in agent loading or command execution

## Story 1.2: Data Ingestion - PyAirbyte Integration

As a **data engineer**,
I want to ingest data from multiple sources through PyAirbyte connectors,
so that I can work with diverse datasets in the BMad-Method framework.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Node.js wrapper for PyAirbyte Python execution
2. Create data ingestion API endpoints for file upload and database connections
3. Configure PyAirbyte connectors for common sources (CSV, JSON, databases)
4. Implement stream selection and cache management capabilities
5. Create ingestion task templates (data-source-discovery.md)

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing CLI tools remain functional with new Python dependencies
- IV2: PyAirbyte subprocess execution doesn't block Node.js event loop
- IV3: Memory usage remains within acceptable limits during data ingestion

## Story 1.3: Local Analytics - DuckDB Integration

As a **data analyst**,
I want to perform analytical queries using DuckDB as an embedded engine,
so that I can process data efficiently without external dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integrate DuckDB with Node.js through appropriate bindings
2. Implement data loading from PyAirbyte cache to DuckDB
3. Create analytical query interfaces for agent workflows
4. Support larger-than-memory datasets through partitioning
5. Enable multi-format data reading (CSV, Parquet, JSON)

### Integration Verification
- IV1: File-based YAML/Markdown storage remains unaffected
- IV2: DuckDB operations isolated from core framework processes
- IV3: System remains responsive during analytical operations

## Story 1.4: Transformation Workflows - dbt-core Integration

As a **data engineer**,
I want to define and execute transformation workflows using dbt-core,
so that I can maintain data quality and lineage.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integrate dbt-core with Python subprocess execution
2. Create guided ELT modeling templates (elt-modeling-guidance.md)
3. Implement dbt project initialization within expansion pack
4. Configure testing patterns (generic and custom tests)
5. Enable documentation generation from dbt models

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing validation scripts continue functioning
- IV2: dbt operations don't interfere with BMad build processes
- IV3: Test execution times remain reasonable (<5 minutes for standard suite)

## Story 1.5: Workflow Orchestration - Dagster Integration

As a **data architect**,
I want to orchestrate data pipelines using Dagster's asset-centric approach,
so that I can manage complex data workflows with proper dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement Dagster integration with configuration management
2. Create asset definitions for data pipeline components
3. Configure scheduling and triggering mechanisms
4. Implement monitoring and alerting interfaces
5. Enable lineage tracking and visualization

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Existing workflow patterns in BMad-Method remain functional
- IV2: Dagster UI accessible without conflicting with other tools
- IV3: Resource usage remains manageable with Dagster daemon running

## Story 1.6: Automated Analysis - EDA and Hypothesis Generation

As a **data analyst**,
I want automated exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation,
so that I can discover insights more efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integrate automated EDA tools (pandas-profiling, Sweetviz, AutoViz)
2. Implement LLM-agnostic hypothesis generation interfaces
3. Create hypothesis testing workflows (hypothesis-testing.md)
4. Configure statistical testing frameworks
5. Enable pattern detection and anomaly identification

### Integration Verification
- IV1: LLM interfaces compatible with existing agent LLM usage
- IV2: Analysis tools don't conflict with existing dependencies
- IV3: Processing times remain acceptable for interactive workflows

## Story 1.7: Publication Platform - Evidence.dev Integration

As a **data product manager**,
I want to generate publication-quality insight documents,
so that I can share analysis results in professional formats.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integrate Evidence.dev with build system
2. Create publication templates (insight-document.md)
3. Configure Universal SQL with DuckDB WASM
4. Implement automated narrative generation workflows
5. Enable static site generation and deployment

### Integration Verification
- IV1: Web-builder continues to function for agent bundles
- IV2: Evidence.dev builds don't interfere with main build process
- IV3: Generated sites maintain acceptable performance metrics

## Story 1.8: Quality Assurance and Documentation

As a **data QA engineer**,
I want comprehensive testing and documentation for the expansion pack,
so that the system maintains quality and usability standards.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create data quality validation checklists
2. Implement integration tests for all data tools
3. Generate comprehensive documentation for data workflows
4. Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
5. Validate all milestone deliverables function correctly

### Integration Verification
- IV1: All existing BMad-Method functionality remains intact
- IV2: New components pass integration tests with >80% coverage
- IV3: Documentation integrates with existing user guides
