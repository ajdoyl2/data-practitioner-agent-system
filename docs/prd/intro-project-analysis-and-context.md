# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Analysis Source
**Document-project output available at**: `/Users/ajdoyle/data-practitioner-agent-system/Phase1doc.md`

## Current Project State
Based on the available documentation, this is the **BMad-Method** framework - a Node.js-based system designed to orchestrate AI agents for agile development. The architecture centers around a `bmad-core` directory containing modular, natural language definitions for agents, tasks, and templates written in Markdown and YAML. Command-line tools process these core files, resolving dependencies and bundling them into single-file contexts for different environments.

## Available Documentation Analysis
**Note**: Document-project analysis available - using existing technical documentation

Key documents from document-project output:
- ✓ Tech Stack Documentation (Node.js >=20.0.0, commander, fs-extra, js-yaml, etc.)
- ✓ Source Tree/Architecture (bmad-core structure with agents, tasks, templates)
- ✓ API Documentation (Agent command APIs via YAML configuration)
- ✓ External API Documentation (NPM, GitHub integrations)
- ✓ Technical Debt Documentation (Configuration complexity, dual environment maintenance, lack of automated tests)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type
✓ Integration with New Systems  
✓ Major Feature Modification  
✓ New Feature Addition  

### Enhancement Description
Adding a comprehensive Data Practitioner expansion pack that integrates autonomous analysis capabilities, modern data stack tools (DuckDB, dbt, PyAirbyte, Dagster, Evidence.dev), and publication-quality insight generation into the BMad-Method framework. This represents a major extension of BMad-Method from pure software development into data analysis and intelligence workflows.

### Impact Assessment
✓ **Significant Impact** - This enhancement requires:
- New agent definitions (6 specialized data agents)
- New task workflows for data analysis
- Integration with external data tools and frameworks
- New templates for data-specific documentation
- Infrastructure additions for data processing capabilities

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable autonomous data analysis workflows through specialized AI agents
- Integrate modern data stack tools (DuckDB, dbt, PyAirbyte, Dagster) for ELT processing
- Support API and data file ingestion from diverse sources
- Generate publication-quality insight documents via Evidence.dev integration
- Provide guided ELT modeling and hypothesis generation capabilities
- Implement statistical analysis automation with human-AI collaboration

### Background Context
The BMad-Method has proven successful as an agentic framework for software development workflows. This expansion extends the framework into data practitioner domains, leveraging the same natural language framework and modular design patterns to create sophisticated data analysis capabilities. The expansion pack will follow BMad-Method's established patterns while adding specialized workflows for data discovery, transformation, analysis, and publication-quality reporting.
