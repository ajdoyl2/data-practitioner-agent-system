# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** The expansion pack shall integrate with BMad-Method's existing expansion pack architecture, following the established directory structure (agents/, templates/, tasks/, checklists/, data/) and configuration patterns.

- **FR2:** The system shall provide six specialized data agents (data-product-manager, data-architect, data-engineer, data-analyst, ml-engineer, data-qa-engineer) that follow BMad-Method's YAML-based agent definition patterns.

- **FR3:** The system shall integrate PyAirbyte for flexible data ingestion, supporting selective data loading through stream selection and cache management with connectivity to various data sources through Python-native integration.

- **FR4:** The system shall integrate DuckDB as the local analytical engine for in-process data processing, supporting larger-than-memory datasets through smart partitioning.

- **FR5:** The system shall integrate dbt-core for transformation workflows, supporting the layered architecture approach (Source → Staging → Intermediate → Marts) with comprehensive testing patterns and documentation generation.

- **FR6:** The system shall enable automated exploratory data analysis through integration with tools like pandas-profiling, Sweetviz, and AutoViz.

- **FR7:** The system shall implement LLM-agnostic hypothesis generation capabilities, supporting any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models) through configurable interfaces while maintaining causal knowledge graph integration.

- **FR8:** The system shall generate publication-quality insight documents through Evidence.dev integration, supporting Pew Research-style narratives with interactive visualizations.

- **FR9:** The system shall provide workflow orchestration through Dagster integration with asset-centric design and comprehensive lineage tracking.

- **FR10:** The system shall support both local development and cloud deployment patterns, scaling from DuckDB local processing to cloud data warehouse integration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** The expansion pack must maintain compatibility with BMad-Method's existing Node.js >=20.0.0 runtime requirements and not introduce conflicting dependencies.

- **NFR2:** The system shall maintain response times of <3 seconds for interactive analysis operations and <100ms for UI interactions through Evidence.dev.

- **NFR3:** The expansion pack must support BMad-Method's two-phase approach (Planning in Web UI, Development in IDE) without breaking existing workflows.

- **NFR4:** The system shall provide comprehensive data quality validation with automated testing achieving ≥80% coverage for critical data pipelines.

- **NFR5:** The expansion pack must maintain BMad-Method's natural language framework philosophy, with all agent definitions and workflows written in Markdown/YAML.

- **NFR6:** The system shall support incremental milestone delivery over 16 weeks, with each 4-week milestone providing independent value.

- **NFR7:** All data processing must maintain audit logging and support role-based access control for enterprise governance requirements.

- **NFR8:** The system shall handle datasets ranging from megabytes to terabytes through appropriate scaling strategies (local to cloud).

## Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1:** The expansion pack must maintain full compatibility with existing BMad-Method CLI tools (bmad.js, web-builder.js, installer) without requiring modifications to core framework code.

- **CR2:** All new agent definitions must follow existing YAML schema patterns including activation-instructions, commands, dependencies, and persona definitions.

- **CR3:** The expansion pack must integrate with existing IDE configurations (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot) through established .bmad-core patterns.

- **CR4:** New templates must maintain compatibility with BMad-Method's template engine, supporting elicitation directives and LLM instructions in existing formats.
