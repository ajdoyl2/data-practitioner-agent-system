# Data Practitioner Agent System Brownfield Enhancement Architecture

## Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing BMad-Method with a comprehensive Data Practitioner expansion pack. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of data analysis capabilities while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing BMad-Method architecture by defining how new data processing components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

### Existing Project Analysis

#### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** BMad-Method framework - Node.js-based system for orchestrating AI agents in agile development
- **Current Tech Stack:** Node.js >=20.0.0, YAML/Markdown-based agent definitions, CLI tools for processing and bundling
- **Architecture Style:** Natural language framework with modular expansion pack architecture
- **Deployment Method:** NPM package distribution with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

#### Available Documentation
- Complete project analysis available from document-project output
- Tech Stack Documentation (Node.js >=20.0.0, commander, fs-extra, js-yaml, etc.)
- Source Tree/Architecture (bmad-core structure with agents, tasks, templates)
- API Documentation (Agent command APIs via YAML configuration)
- Technical Debt Documentation (Configuration complexity, dual environment maintenance)

#### Identified Constraints
- Must maintain Node.js >=20.0.0 runtime compatibility
- Natural language framework philosophy must be preserved
- Expansion pack architecture patterns must be followed
- Zero impact on existing BMad-Method functionality

### Change Log
| Change | Date | Version | Description | Author |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Initial | 2025-08-08 | 1.0 | Data Practitioner expansion pack architecture | Winston |
| Complete | 2025-08-08 | 1.1 | Comprehensive architecture with validation | Winston |

## Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

### Enhancement Overview
**Enhancement Type:** Integration with New Systems + Major Feature Modification + New Infrastructure  
**Scope:** Comprehensive data practitioner expansion pack with 6 specialized agents, modern data stack integration (PyAirbyte, DuckDB, dbt-core/SQLmesh, Dagster, Evidence.dev), and publication-quality insight generation  
**Integration Impact:** Significant - Introduces Python ecosystem dependencies while maintaining full compatibility with existing Node.js infrastructure

### Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** Follow established expansion pack patterns - create `/bmad-data-practitioner/` directory with standard subdirectories (agents/, templates/, tasks/, checklists/, data/). All new agents follow existing YAML-based definition patterns with natural language workflows.

**Database Integration:** Introduce DuckDB as embedded analytical database operating alongside existing file-based YAML/Markdown storage. No changes to existing data persistence - DuckDB handles only data processing workloads while framework configurations remain in files.

**API Integration:** Add new REST and WebSocket endpoints for data ingestion under existing `tools/` directory structure. PyAirbyte connectors wrapped in Node.js interfaces to maintain framework consistency and preserve existing CLI tool patterns.

**UI Integration:** Evidence.dev operates as separate static site generator consuming data pipeline outputs. Integration through existing `web-builder.js` patterns with new build targets for publication sites, maintaining separation from agent bundling workflows.

### Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** All existing agent commands, CLI tools, and web-builder functionality remains unchanged. New data ingestion APIs added as separate endpoints without modifying existing interfaces.
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** No existing "database schema" to maintain (file-based storage). DuckDB operates in isolation for data processing only, with no impact on YAML/Markdown file structures.
- **UI/UX Consistency:** New data agents follow identical interaction patterns to existing agents. Evidence.dev publications maintain separate UI space, accessed through new commands but not interfering with existing web bundle generation.
- **Performance Impact:** Data processing operations isolated in separate processes/subprocesses to prevent blocking existing Node.js event loop. Memory usage managed through configurable DuckDB limits and automatic spilling strategies.

### Integration Guidelines

**File Naming Consistency:** All data agents follow hyphenated naming convention matching existing agent patterns, task files use verb-noun patterns consistent with existing task naming, template files maintain .yaml extension following existing template structure.

**Folder Organization Approach:** Complete expansion pack structure under `/expansion-packs/bmad-data-practitioner/` following established patterns, data processing services organized under `/tools/data-services/` for clear separation from core tools.

**Import/Export Pattern Consistency:** All new JavaScript modules use existing ES6 import/export patterns, YAML configuration loading follows existing yaml-utils.js patterns, agent definition processing maintains existing dependency-resolver.js integration.

## Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

### Existing Infrastructure

**Current Deployment:** NPM package distribution with semantic-release automation, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated versioning and publishing  
**Infrastructure Tools:** GitHub Actions workflows, semantic-release for automated versioning, NPM registry for package distribution  
**Environments:** Development (local), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Production (NPM registry), User installations (various local environments)

### Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Extended NPM package distribution with multi-runtime support - maintains existing Node.js package structure while adding Python environment management and data tool orchestration

**Infrastructure Changes:**
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflows to include Python dependency validation and testing
- Added Python virtual environment creation and management during installation process
- DuckDB database initialization and configuration during expansion pack setup
- Evidence.dev build integration with existing web-builder deployment patterns

**Pipeline Integration:** Pre-existing semantic-release workflow extended with Python tool version validation, enhanced installer process includes Python runtime detection and virtual environment setup, build process enhanced to validate data tool dependencies.

### Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Method:** Modular component rollback with dependency isolation - individual data components can be disabled without affecting core BMad-Method functionality

**Risk Mitigation:** All data processing components isolated in separate processes to prevent core system impact, database operations use transaction-based approaches with automatic rollback on failure, configuration-driven feature toggles allow selective component disabling.

**Monitoring Integration:** Existing BMad CLI progress indication extended with data pipeline monitoring, Dagster web UI integration provides comprehensive pipeline observability, health check endpoints for all data services with automatic recovery procedures.

## Coding Standards and Conventions

### Existing Standards Compliance

**Code Style:** Natural language framework with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content, JavaScript ES6+ modules with consistent async/await patterns following existing tools/ directory conventions  
**Linting Rules:** Prettier ^3.5.3 for Markdown/YAML formatting, ESLint patterns inferred from existing codebase structure, consistent indentation and naming conventions  
**Testing Patterns:** Jest ^30.0.4 testing framework with minimal current coverage, focus on integration testing over unit testing, CLI tool validation through existing validation scripts  
**Documentation Style:** Markdown-based with YAML configuration, embedded instructions for LLM processing, natural language workflow descriptions with structured metadata

### Enhancement-Specific Standards

- **Python Code Integration Standards:** All Python code executed through Node.js subprocess interfaces, Python scripts follow PEP 8 standards with black formatting, virtual environment isolation with pinned dependency versions
- **Data Processing Standards:** SQL queries follow consistent formatting and naming conventions, transformation models use standardized layering (source → staging → intermediate → marts), DuckDB operations wrapped with proper error handling and resource management
- **Configuration Management Standards:** All data tool configurations stored in YAML following existing technical-preferences patterns, environment-specific settings isolated in separate configuration files, sensitive credentials encrypted using existing BMad security patterns
- **API Endpoint Standards:** RESTful endpoint design following existing CLI command patterns, consistent error response formats with proper HTTP status codes, JSON schema validation for all request/response payloads
- **Agent Workflow Standards:** Data agents follow identical YAML schema structure as existing agents, natural language instructions maintain existing elicitation and template patterns, cross-agent workflow coordination uses established handoff mechanisms

### Critical Integration Rules

**Existing API Compatibility:** All existing BMad-Method CLI commands, agent workflows, and web-builder functionality must remain completely unchanged - new functionality is purely additive through expansion pack patterns

## Next Steps

### Story Manager Handoff

Please begin implementation of the Data Practitioner Agent System expansion pack using the completed architecture document at `docs/architecture.md` and PRD at `docs/prd.md`. 

**Key Integration Requirements Validated:**
- BMad-Method expansion pack patterns must be followed exactly (agents/, templates/, tasks/, checklists/, data/ structure)
- Python tools integrated through Node.js subprocess execution to maintain framework consistency
- DuckDB operates as embedded analytics engine without impacting existing file-based storage
- All existing BMad functionality must remain completely unchanged - this is purely additive

**Existing System Constraints Based on Project Analysis:**
- Node.js >=20.0.0 runtime requirement maintained
- YAML-based agent definitions with natural language workflows preserved
- CLI tool patterns extended, never modified
- Web-builder functionality enhanced with new data tool bundling capabilities

**First Story to Implement:** Story 1.1 - Foundation (Data Agent Infrastructure Setup)
- Create `/bmad-data-practitioner/` expansion pack directory structure
- Implement 6 data agent definitions following existing YAML schema patterns
- Integrate with existing installer and web-builder tools
- **Critical Integration Checkpoint:** Validate existing agents continue functioning unchanged

**Maintaining System Integrity:** Each story must include Integration Verification steps to ensure existing BMad-Method functionality remains intact throughout implementation. No story should be marked complete without validating IV1, IV2, and IV3 requirements.

### Developer Handoff

Begin implementing the Data Practitioner expansion pack following the architecture at `docs/architecture.md` and existing BMad-Method coding standards analyzed from the project structure.

**Integration Requirements with Existing Codebase:**
- Follow established expansion pack patterns seen in `expansion-packs/bmad-2d-phaser-game-dev/` and `expansion-packs/bmad-infrastructure-devops/`
- All Python tool integration must use subprocess execution with proper error handling
- Extend existing CLI patterns in `tools/` directory without modifying core functionality
- Use existing YAML configuration patterns from `core-config.yaml` and `technical-preferences.md`

**Key Technical Decisions Based on Project Constraints:**
- DuckDB embedded approach maintains BMad-Method's simplicity philosophy
- PyAirbyte, dbt-core, SQLmesh, Dagster executed through Python subprocess interfaces
- Evidence.dev integrated through existing web-builder patterns
- Virtual environment isolation prevents dependency conflicts

**Existing System Compatibility Requirements with Verification Steps:**
- **Pre-Implementation:** Run `npm run validate` to establish baseline functionality
- **During Development:** Each component must pass integration tests with existing system
- **Post-Implementation:** All existing CLI commands, agent workflows, and build processes must function identically
- **Performance Validation:** No degradation in existing BMad-Method response times

**Clear Implementation Sequencing:**
1. **Foundation Phase:** Expansion pack structure and agent definitions (Week 1-2)
2. **Data Ingestion:** PyAirbyte integration with Node.js wrappers (Week 3-4)  
3. **Analytics Engine:** DuckDB integration with memory management (Week 5-6)
