# Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security incident response procedures for the BMad Data Practitioner system.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate threat to data or system | < 15 minutes | Data breach, system compromise, ransomware |
| **High** | Significant security risk | < 1 hour | Brute force attacks, SQL injection attempts |
| **Medium** | Moderate security concern | < 4 hours | Suspicious activity, policy violations |
| **Low** | Minor security issue | < 24 hours | Failed login attempts, configuration issues |

## Response Team

### Primary Contacts

1. **Security Lead**: First point of contact for all incidents
2. **System Administrator**: Infrastructure and access control
3. **Development Lead**: Application security and patches
4. **Data Protection Officer**: Privacy and compliance issues

### Escalation Path

```
Detection → Security Lead → System Admin → Development Lead → Management
                    ↓
            Data Protection Officer (if data breach)
```

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Detection & Analysis

**Automated Detection**:
- Security monitoring alerts
- Intrusion detection system
- Log analysis anomalies
- User reports

**Initial Assessment**:
```bash
# Check active threats
bmad security-status

# Review recent security events
bmad security-logs --recent

# Check system integrity
bmad health-check --security
```

### 2. Containment

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**
   ```bash
   # Disable compromised features
   bmad disable-feature [feature-name]
   
   # Revoke suspicious API keys
   bmad revoke-key [api-key]
   
   # Block malicious IPs
   bmad block-ip [ip-address]
   ```

2. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Create forensic snapshot
   bmad security-snapshot --incident [incident-id]
   
   # Export security logs
   bmad export-logs --security --from [timestamp]
   ```

### 3. Eradication

**Remove Threat**:

1. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Review security logs
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Check for backdoors

2. **Clean Systems**
   ```bash
   # Run security scan
   bmad security-scan --deep
   
   # Remove malicious files
   bmad cleanup --security
   
   # Reset compromised credentials
   bmad reset-credentials --all
   ```

### 4. Recovery

**Restore Operations**:

1. **Verify System Integrity**
   ```bash
   # Run integrity checks
   bmad verify-integrity
   
   # Test all services
   bmad test --all
   ```

2. **Gradual Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Re-enable features one by one
   bmad enable-feature [feature] --verify
   
   # Monitor for anomalies
   bmad monitor --enhanced
   ```

### 5. Post-Incident

**Lessons Learned**:

1. **Incident Report**
   - Timeline of events
   - Actions taken
   - Impact assessment
   - Prevention recommendations

2. **System Updates**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Update security policies
   - Enhance monitoring

## Specific Incident Playbooks

### Brute Force Attack

**Detection**: Multiple failed authentication attempts

**Response**:
1. Block attacking IP automatically (after 5 failures)
2. Alert security team
3. Review targeted accounts
4. Enforce password reset if compromised

### SQL Injection Attempt

**Detection**: Malicious patterns in requests

**Response**:
1. Block request immediately
2. Log full request details
3. Review application code
4. Deploy input validation patches

### API Key Compromise

**Detection**: Unusual API usage patterns

**Response**:
1. Revoke compromised key
2. Audit key usage history
3. Notify affected users
4. Issue new credentials

### Data Breach

**Detection**: Unauthorized data access/export

**Response**:
1. Immediate containment
2. Assess data scope
3. Legal notification (within 72 hours for GDPR)
4. User notification
5. Regulatory reporting
