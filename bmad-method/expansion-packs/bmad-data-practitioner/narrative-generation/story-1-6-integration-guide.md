## Hypothesis Results Narrative Patterns

### Pattern 1: Supported Hypothesis Narrative
```markdown
**Template: Strong Statistical Support**
"Initial analysis of [data domain] led to the hypothesis that [hypothesis statement]. Statistical testing provides strong evidence supporting this hypothesis.

**Research Question:** [Original business question that motivated the hypothesis]

**Statistical Evidence:** 
- Test statistic: [test type] = [value]
- P-value: p = [value] (p < [significance level])
- Effect size: [measure] = [value] ([interpretation: small/medium/large])
- Confidence interval: [parameter] = [point estimate] (95% CI: [lower, upper])
- Sample size: n = [sample size] ([power analysis result])

**Business Interpretation:**
The data provide [strong/moderate] evidence that [practical interpretation of hypothesis]. With [confidence level]% confidence, we estimate [parameter description] falls between [range] with practical implications for [business context].

**Implications for [Stakeholder Group]:**
These findings suggest [actionable recommendations] with [confidence qualifier] based on statistical evidence. [Implementation suggestions] should be considered given [supporting context].

**Next Steps:**
- [Immediate actions based on confirmed hypothesis]
- [Longer-term strategic implications]
- [Areas requiring additional validation or research]"

**Example:**
"Initial analysis of customer engagement data led to the hypothesis that premium subscribers show significantly higher satisfaction than basic subscribers. Statistical testing provides strong evidence supporting this hypothesis.

**Research Question:** Do premium service features translate into measurably higher customer satisfaction?

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Test statistic: t(441) = 5.23, p < 0.001
- Effect size: Cohen's d = 0.94 (large effect)
- Confidence interval: Mean difference = 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8, 1.8)
- Sample size: n = 443 (power = 0.95)

**Business Interpretation:**
The data provide strong evidence that premium subscribers experience substantially higher satisfaction than basic subscribers. With 95% confidence, we estimate the true satisfaction difference falls between 0.8 and 1.8 points on our 10-point scale, representing meaningful practical significance for customer experience management.

**Implications for Product Management:**
These findings strongly support continued investment in premium features, with high confidence that enhanced services deliver measurable customer value. Premium tier expansion should be prioritized given robust evidence of customer satisfaction benefits.

**Next Steps:**
- Expand premium feature offerings based on validated customer value
- Investigate specific premium features driving satisfaction differences  
- Develop satisfaction-based retention strategies for premium customers"
```

### Pattern 2: Rejected Hypothesis Narrative
```markdown
**Template: Insufficient Statistical Evidence**
"Analysis of [data domain] investigated the hypothesis that [hypothesis statement]. Statistical testing does not provide sufficient evidence to support this hypothesis.

**Research Question:** [Original business question]

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Test statistic: [test type] = [value]  
- P-value: p = [value] (p â‰¥ [significance level])
- Effect size: [measure] = [value] ([interpretation])
- Confidence interval: [parameter] = [point estimate] (95% CI: [lower, upper])
- Sample size: n = [sample size] ([power analysis result])

**Statistical Interpretation:**
The observed differences could reasonably be attributed to random sampling variation. While [sample pattern description], we cannot confidently generalize this pattern beyond the observed data.

**Business Interpretation:**
[Practical implications of non-significant result]. The absence of statistical evidence [does not prove no effect exists/suggests effect size may be smaller than anticipated/indicates need for different approach].

**Alternative Explanations:**
- [Potential confounding factors not controlled]
- [Sample size or power limitations]
- [Measurement or methodology considerations]
- [Timing or contextual factors that may influence results]

**Implications for [Stakeholder Group]:**
Without statistical evidence supporting [hypothesis], decisions should [alternative approach/additional research/maintain status quo] rather than [originally proposed action].

**Next Steps:**
- [Research design modifications for future investigation]
- [Alternative approaches to address original business question]
- [Areas where different data or methods might provide clarity]"
```

### Pattern 3: Inconclusive Results Narrative
```markdown
**Template: Mixed or Borderline Evidence**
"Investigation of [hypothesis statement] yields mixed evidence requiring careful interpretation and additional research.

**Research Question:** [Original business question]

**Statistical Evidence:**
- Test statistic: [test type] = [value]
- P-value: p = [value] (borderline significance: [interpretation])
- Effect size: [measure] = [value] ([small/moderate effect but limited significance])
- Confidence interval: [parameter] = [point estimate] (95% CI: [includes null/wide interval])
- Sample size: n = [sample size] ([power analysis implications])

**Conflicting Indicators:**
- [Statistical measures suggesting evidence]: [details]
- [Statistical measures suggesting caution]: [details]
- [Practical vs. statistical significance considerations]

**Cautious Interpretation:**
The evidence suggests [tentative finding with appropriate uncertainty]. While [pattern observed], [limitations or concerns about generalizability].

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Acting on this evidence**: [Risks and potential benefits]
- **Ignoring this evidence**: [Risks and potential consequences]
- **Recommended approach**: [Conservative/progressive strategy based on risk tolerance]

**Next Steps:**
- [Specific research to resolve uncertainty]
- [Pilot programs or limited implementation with monitoring]
- [Additional data collection to increase precision]"
```

## Integration with Automated EDA Results

### EDA Pattern Validation Narratives
```markdown
**Template: EDA Pattern Confirmed by Hypothesis Testing**
"Exploratory data analysis identified [pattern description] as a potentially significant finding. Formal hypothesis testing confirms this pattern with statistical rigor.

**Initial Discovery:** [EDA finding description with exploratory statistics]
**Hypothesis Formulation:** Based on the exploratory finding, we hypothesized [formal hypothesis]
**Statistical Validation:** [Hypothesis test results using Pattern 1/2/3 above]

**Enhanced Understanding:** 
The combination of exploratory discovery and confirmatory testing provides [level of confidence] in [practical interpretation]. [Additional context from EDA that supports or enriches the hypothesis test results].

**Methodological Note:**
This analysis demonstrates the value of combining exploratory data analysis with confirmatory hypothesis testing. Initial pattern discovery guided formal testing, while statistical validation confirmed the reliability of exploratory observations."
```

### Anomaly Investigation Narratives
```markdown
**Template: Anomaly Explanation Through Hypothesis Testing**
"Automated anomaly detection identified [anomaly description] requiring investigation. Hypothesis testing provides insight into the underlying causes.

**Anomaly Characteristics:** [Statistical description of the anomaly]
**Investigative Hypotheses:** [List of potential explanations tested]
**Testing Results:**

1. **Hypothesis 1** ([explanation]): [Test results and interpretation]
2. **Hypothesis 2** ([explanation]): [Test results and interpretation]
3. **Hypothesis 3** ([explanation]): [Test results and interpretation]

**Conclusion:** 
The anomaly appears to be [most supported explanation] based on statistical evidence. This finding [implications for business operations/data quality/process improvement].

**Monitoring Recommendations:**
[Specific metrics or processes to monitor based on anomaly investigation results]"
