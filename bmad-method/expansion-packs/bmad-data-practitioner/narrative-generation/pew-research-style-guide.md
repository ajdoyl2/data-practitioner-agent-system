# Pew Research Style Publication Guide

## Purpose
Guidelines for creating publication narratives that follow Pew Research Center's professional standards for accessible, authoritative research communication.

## Core Pew Research Style Principles

### 1. Accessible Authority
- **Professional but not academic**: Avoid jargon while maintaining credibility
- **Evidence-based claims**: Every statement backed by data
- **Clear methodology**: Transparent about how conclusions were reached
- **Appropriate confidence**: Match certainty to strength of evidence

### 2. Structured Storytelling
- **Lead with findings**: Most important results first
- **Logical progression**: Findings → Supporting evidence → Implications
- **Clear sections**: Distinct segments with descriptive headings
- **Executive summary**: Standalone overview capturing key points

### 3. Human-Centered Context
- **Real-world relevance**: Connect statistics to human experiences
- **Practical implications**: What do these findings mean for people/organizations?
- **Future-oriented**: What should readers do with this information?
- **Balanced perspective**: Acknowledge limitations and alternative interpretations

## Publication Structure Template

### Executive Summary Format
```markdown
# [Research Topic]: Key Findings

## At a Glance
[2-3 sentence overview of the most important finding]

## Key Findings
1. **[Primary Finding]**: [Statistic] of [population] [action/characteristic] [context]
2. **[Secondary Finding]**: [Supporting statistic with practical implication]
3. **[Tertiary Finding]**: [Additional insight that adds nuance or context]

## What This Means
[Practical implications in 2-3 sentences focusing on actionable insights]

## Methodology Note
This analysis is based on [data source] collected [time period] with [sample size]. [Key methodological strength or limitation].
```

**Example:**
```markdown
# Customer Satisfaction Trends: Key Findings

## At a Glance
Customer satisfaction has reached a five-year high, driven primarily by improvements in premium service tiers, but significant gaps remain across demographic segments.

## Key Findings
1. **Overall Satisfaction Improvement**: 74% of customers rate their experience as "good" or "excellent," up from 61% in 2022
2. **Premium Tier Success**: Premium subscribers show 23% higher satisfaction rates, indicating successful value delivery
3. **Demographic Disparities**: Satisfaction varies significantly by age group, with customers under 30 reporting 15% lower satisfaction rates

## What This Means
Organizations should continue investing in premium service features while addressing the specific needs of younger customers to ensure broad-based satisfaction growth.

## Methodology Note  
This analysis is based on quarterly customer surveys collected from January 2023 through December 2023 with 15,847 respondents. Results are weighted to reflect customer demographic composition.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Language Principles
```markdown
**Use This Style:**
- "Three-quarters (74%) of customers report satisfaction..."
- "The data suggest a strong relationship..."
- "Among premium subscribers, satisfaction rates are notably higher..."

**Avoid This Style:**
- "74% of customers are satisfied" (too terse)
- "The data proves that..." (overstated certainty)
- "Premium customers are way more satisfied" (informal language)
```

### Statistical Presentation
```markdown
**Percentages:**
- Always include base numbers: "74% of customers (n=11,527)"
- Round to whole numbers unless precision is critical
- Use "about" or "roughly" for estimates: "roughly three-quarters"

**Comparisons:**
- Include both absolute and relative differences: "increased from 61% to 74% (a 13 percentage point increase)"
- Use confidence intervals for key findings: "74% (95% CI: 72%-76%)"

**Significance:**
- Avoid p-values in main text; include in methodology
- Use language like "significantly higher" only when statistically significant
- Acknowledge uncertainty: "The data suggest..." rather than "The data show..."
```

### Demographic Reporting Standards
```markdown
**Age Groups:** 
- Use consistent brackets: 18-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65+
- Always report sample sizes by group

**Professional Categories:**
- Use clear, accessible job descriptions
- Avoid jargon: "managers and executives" not "C-suite professionals"

**Statistical Comparisons:**
- Always note when differences are not statistically significant
- Highlight practically significant differences even if not statistically significant
```

## Visual Integration Guidelines

### Chart Descriptions (Pew Style)
```markdown
**Template: Survey Results Chart**
"Figure [X] shows the distribution of responses to [question]. The majority of respondents ([percentage]) selected [option], while [percentage] chose [alternative]. Notable differences emerge when examining responses by [demographic characteristic], with [group] showing [direction] preferences compared to [comparison group]."

**Example:**
"Figure 1 shows the distribution of customer satisfaction ratings. The majority of respondents (74%) rated their experience as good or excellent, while 18% provided neutral ratings. Notable differences emerge when examining responses by subscription type, with premium subscribers showing substantially higher satisfaction (89%) compared to basic subscribers (68%)."
```

### Dashboard Integration
```markdown
**Template: Interactive Dashboard Description**
"The interactive dashboard below allows readers to explore [data topic] by [filtering options]. Key patterns to note include [primary pattern] and [secondary pattern]. Use the dropdown menus to examine results by [demographic/temporal/categorical breakdown]."
```

## Narrative Flow Patterns

### Opening Hooks (Pew Style)
```markdown
**Pattern 1: Surprising Finding**
"Despite widespread concerns about [issue], the data reveal a more complex picture: [counterintuitive finding]."

**Pattern 2: Context Setting**  
"As [industry/society] continues to [trend/change], understanding [specific aspect] has become increasingly important."

**Pattern 3: Direct Finding Statement**
"[Percentage] of [population] now [behavior/opinion], according to new analysis of [data source]."
```

### Transition Phrases
```markdown
**Between sections:**
- "The data also reveal..."
- "A closer examination shows..."
- "When broken down by [category]..."
- "This pattern becomes even more pronounced when..."

**Introducing nuance:**
- "However, the picture is more complex when..."
- "These overall trends mask important variations..."
- "While the general pattern holds, notable exceptions include..."
```

### Concluding Sections
```markdown
**Template: Policy/Business Implications**
"These findings have important implications for [stakeholder group]. The data suggest that [primary recommendation] while also highlighting the need to [secondary consideration]. Organizations should consider [specific actions] to [desired outcome]."

**Template: Future Research**
"Several questions emerge from this analysis that merit further investigation. Future research should examine [specific question 1] and explore [specific question 2]. Additionally, longitudinal analysis would help determine whether [trend observation] represents a lasting shift or temporary fluctuation."
```
